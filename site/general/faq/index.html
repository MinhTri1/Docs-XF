<p class="admonition-title">What is XinFin Network?</p>
<p>XinFin Network is an innovative solution to the scalability problem of the Ethereum blockchain, and other current blockchain platforms.
XinFin Network relies on a system of 21 Masternodes with Proof of Stake Voting (POSV) consensus that can support low transaction fees and 2-second transaction confirmation times.
Security, stability and chain finality are guaranteed via novel techniques such as double validation, staking via smart-contracts and true randomization processes.</p>
<p>XinFin Network supports all EVM-compatible smart-contracts, protocols, and atomic cross-chain token transfers.
New scaling techniques such as sharding, EVM parallelisation, private-chain generation, hardware integration will be continuously researched and incorporated into XinFin Network's Masternode architecture.
It will be an ideal scalable smart-contract public blockchain for decentralized apps, token issuances and token integrations for small and big businesses.</p>
</div>
<div class="admonition quote">
<p class="admonition-title">What problem is XinFin Network aiming to solve?</p>
<p>The problems that XinFin Network aims to solve can be summarized as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>The network congestion on Ethereum (low transaction time)</li>
<li>High transaction fees on Ethereum</li>
<li>Most other blockchains are highly centralized and/or do not have interoperability with Ethereum system</li>
</ul>
<p>Blockchain has become one of the most disruptive technologies that enables many decentralized applications, including but not limited to cryptocurrencies, smart-contracts, voting and supply-chain management.
Blockchain proponents have been trying to inject it into this Industry 4.0 revolution era.
In order to reach this goal, the current blockchain infrastructure must at least be able to compete with many mainstream technologies, such as Visa and MasterCard processors in financial services.
Nevertheless, the reality is disappointing: Bitcoin and Ethereum can only process around 7 and 15 transactions per second, respectively.
Remember that, these numbers in Visa and MasterCard are around 5'000-6'000 transactions per second.</p>
<p>XinFin Network is continuously working and researching several scaling solutions.
Regarding on-chain scaling, Sharding and Proof-of-Stake-based consensus are of potential that can significantly improve transaction processing performance while trying to maintain security requirements of the system. </p>
<p>XinFin Network supports low fee and 2-second transaction confirmation times.
XinFin Network can currently process 2'000-5'000 transactions per second (TPS) and once sharding is enabled, XinFin Network is expected to reach 20'000-30'000 TPS.</p>
</div>
<div class="admonition quote">
<p class="admonition-title">How does XinFin Network work? What is the architecture and consensus used?</p>
<p>XinFin Network relies on a system of 150 Masternodes with Proof of Stake Voting (POSV) consensus that can support low fees (approx. 1/100 of that of Ethereum's) and 2-second transaction confirmation times.
Security, stability and chain finality are guaranteed via novel techniques such as Double Validation, staking via smart-contracts and true randomization processes.</p>
</div>
<div class="admonition quote">
<p class="admonition-title">Can you tell more about Proof of Stake Voting (PoSV)? What is it?</p>
<p>At the heart of XinFin Network, the Proof-of-Stake Voting (PoSV) consensus enables XinFin Network as an EVM-compatible and scalable public blockchain, on which every Ethereum smart contract can be effectively run with almost instant transaction confirmation.</p>
<p>PoSV features its Masternode architecture in which token holders deposit 50k XinFin to become a masternode candidate and receive votes from other token holders.
The most voted masternode candidates are selected as masternodes for block creation within a period, called epoch.
Each masternode takes its block creation in a round-robin manner every 2-second and follows the double validation technique for security reinforcement.
A block is finalised if it is signed off by 3/4 masternodes.
At the end of each epoch, the masternodes that have signed finalised blocks are rewarded.
Stakers who voted for those masternodes will also be rewarded.</p>
</div>
<div class="admonition quote">
<p class="admonition-title">What is Double Validation?</p>
<p>Double Validation provides an additional trustless validation layer for security enhancement through a provable uniform distribution decentralized randomization.
Specifically, when a block is created by a masternode, it must be verified by another masternode that is randomly selected among the set of masternodes before being added to the blockchain.
Double validation strengthens XinFinchain’s security, reduces fork and nothing-at-stake attacks, and makes XinFin Network unique among other Proof-of-Stake-based blockchains.</p>
</div>
<div class="admonition quote">
<p class="admonition-title">What is an 'epoch'?</p>
<p>An epoch is a 900-block period of 2-second block time starting from block #1 (900 blocks x 2s/block = around 1800s or ~30 minutes).</p>
</div>
<div class="admonition quote">
<p class="admonition-title">Which scaling solutions will XinFin Network implement? Will you have sharding?</p>
<p>XinFin Network solutions are based on on-chain scaling built into an architecture of 150 voted masternodes with our Proof-of-stake Voting (POSV) consensus protocol.
We achieve 2-second block-time and almost instant transaction confirmation.</p>
<p>To scale further our infrastructure, we have presented our <a href="https://bit.ly/2xHK0u3">Sharding proposal</a> for uniquely integrating Sharding into our current architecture and consensus.
The implementation of sharding is on-going and we will enable it in Q2 2019, after XinFin Network decentralized exchange (XinFinX) launch.</p>
<p>Besides sharding, we are actively researching scalability solutions like EVM parallelization and Plasma.
New scaling techniques such as sharding, EVM parallelisation, private-chain generation, hardware integration will be evaluated before being integrated into XinFin Network's masternode architecture.</p>
</div>
<div class="admonition quote">
<p class="admonition-title">What is the current TPS? What is your targeted transaction speed and when do you think you can achieve that speed?</p>
<p>XinFin Network supports low transaction fees (approx. 1/100 of that of Ethereum's) and 2-second transaction confirmation times.
The mainnet with POSV Masternodes delivers 2'000 transactions per second (TPS).
Once sharding is implemented by Q2 2019, we expect 20'000-30'000 TPS.</p>
<p>XinFin Network team is continuously researching other scaling techniques to keep improving.</p>
</div>
<div class="admonition quote">
<p class="admonition-title">What makes XinFin Network different?</p>
<p>The unique point of XinFin Network comes from technology, the products and the ecosystem.</p>
<p><strong>Novel technology:</strong> includes</p>
<ul>
<li>Proof of Stake Voting consensus</li>
<li>Build in governance D-app</li>

<ul>
<li>XinFin Network also is working vigorously on building its ecosystem and has sealed many partnerships from all fields such as agriculture, robotics, gaming, IT solution providers, advertising, pharmaceutical tracking, education and research, payment, communication, name service, food traceability, tourism etc such as TechInAsia, Kambria, Axie Infinity, Vnext, Farmatrust, TE-Food, Triip Protocol, Portal Network...</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="admonition quote">
<p class="admonition-title">How does XinFin Network compare with other available blockchain projects?</p>
<p>Some of our competitors are EOS.IO, Casper FFG, Cardano, Tendermint, Lisk.
We are doing a series of Medium posts on this matter.</p>
<p>Some posts have been published, such as <a href="https://medium.com/XinFin Network/blockchain-comparison-overview-eos-io-casper-ffg-cardano-tendermint-and-XinFin Network-2b0df68806b6">"Blockchain comparison overview: EOS.IO, Casper FFG, Cardano, Tendermint and XinFinchain"</a>,

<p>The world is a pretty big place, and startups often kill themselves because they cannot make a desirable product, not because of the competition.
At the moment, besides the core XinFin Network platform, we want to focus on a few quality Dapp use cases that can make a difference.
Quality before quantity.</p>
<p>Our core blockchain solution like the sharding proposal is of very high quality, and potentially better than multiple high profile attempts at scaling currently.
The solution is also very unique to XinFin Network's Marsternode design, which will remain our competitive product advantage for a long time.</p>
<p>There are also several other product solutions in design stage which also highly integrate with XinFinchain's overall design.
These product innovations is one of the core competencies we have that make XinFinchain very unique compared to other big projects.
We are doing our best to solve the scalability problem, maximize the TPS and stay strong in our target market. </p>
</div>
<div class="admonition quote">
<p class="admonition-title">Which blockchain(s) are XinFin Network's main competitors?</p>
<p>On the one hand, all base layer blockchains such as Ethereum, EOS, NEM, NEO, XinFin Network etc are competitors because app developers/token issuers will generally choose only one blockchain to work on.
On the other hand, it is too early to focus on competition as it is more important to expand the whole blockchain ecosystem rather than to compete.</p>
<p>XinFin Network has a unique position in which it adds value to the Ethereum ecosystem by addressing scalability and governance issues while keeping the same smart-contracts and general architecture.</p>
</div>
<div class="admonition quote">
<p class="admonition-title">XinFin Network is EVM-compatible. What does that mean?</p>
<p>EVM means Ethereum Virtual Machine.
XinFin Network supports all EVM-compatible smart-contracts, protocols, and atomic cross-chain token transfers.
This means that any smart-contract written in Ethereum protocol can be easily ported to XinFin Network.
Any d-App written in Ethereum can be seamlessly ported to XinFin Network.</p>
</div>
<div class="admonition quote">
<p class="admonition-title">Is XinFin Network a side-chain of Ethereum?</p>
<p>XinFin Network has its own blockchain since XinFin Network Mainnet was launched in December 14th, 2018.</p>
</div>
<div class="admonition quote">
<p class="admonition-title">Is XinFin Network compatible with Ethereum?</p>
<p>Yes, any smart-contract written in Ethereum protocol can be easily ported to XinFin Network.
This is one strength appealing to some dApp developers and some of our partners.</p>
</div>
<div class="admonition quote">
<p class="admonition-title">Can developers make hybrid dApps using both Ethereum and XinFin Network in one single dApp?</p>
<p>Yes, they can make an app, and deploy it to both Ethereum, and XinFin Network.
It can be done relatively easy since XinFin Network supports EVM, and share a common architecture with Ethereum.</p>
</div>
<div class="admonition quote">
<p class="admonition-title">How do you solve 'security problems' when using XinFin Network?</p>
<p>In terms of security of consensus protocol, XinFin Network proposes Double Validation and Randomization to protect the system.
The details of these techniques can be referred in our <a href="https://xinfin.org/docs/technical-whitepaper--1.0.pdf">Technical paper</a>.</p>
<p>XinFin Network solves some consensus-related security aspects:</p>
<ol>
<li>Nothing-at-stake problem: This problem is commonly discussed in PoS-based blockchain consensus and just like 51% attacks in PoW. XinFin Network solves it by using Double Validation and Randomization.
    The details are shown in our technical paper.</li>
<li>Long-range attacks: Attackers can try to recreate all blocks from a very far position to the current block.
    Attackers can do that because PoS-based consensus does not require extra-ordinary hashing power to re-write the whole blockchain.
    XinFin Network addresses by providing finality.
    Once a block is signed by at least 3/4 masternodes, it is consider irreversible, meaning that any attempt to re-write the blockchain history will be rejected.</li>
<li>Censorship-resistance: Please <a href="https://medium.com/XinFin Network/XinFin Network-vs-eos-io-the-battle-of-posv-vs-dpos-or-just-some-coincidence-of-design-philosophy-b5f606a1e5df">refer to this medium article</a> for more detailed analysis</li>
<li>DDoS and spamming attacks: XinFin Network's transaction fee is not zero (even it is very low), attackers still require a significant amount of XinFin in order to flood the network for only a short time.</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="admonition quote">
<p class="admonition-title">How does XinFin Network defend against spamming attacks?</p>
<p>XinFin Network has different measures to defend against spamming attacks.</p>
<p>For instance, increasing transaction fees for smart contract creation is one of them.
The min is 10 XinFin. Otherwise an error of smart contract creation cost is under allowance may show up.</p>

<p>All the code regarding XinFin Network is free to consult on our <a href="https://github.com/xinfinorg">GitHub</a>.
This includes the code for the XinFin Network blockchain client, governance DApp, block explorer, tools, docker images, documentation, etc.</p>
<p>However, other blockchain related projects like ReplyBlock or drafts, work-in-progress and not yet disclosed projects are usually kept in private repositories.</p>
<p>We like to publish code publicly when it reaches a certain level of development and/or when we think auditing and contributions are beneficial to the codebase.
Keeping early projects private is probably more responsible for now due to our scale.
It might change in the future.</p>
<p>We are also working with some third parties with which we signed a non-disclosure-agreements for code development.</p>

<p class="admonition-title">What is XinFin? Can you describe the functions and purposes of XinFin?</p>
<p>XinFin is the native cryptocurrency of XinFin Network and will be the reserve cryptocurrency for all third-party apps running on XinFin Network.
Being the protocol token for the XinFin Network infrastructure, XinFin will be needed by all parties utilising XinFin Network to build apps or issue and integrate cryptographic tokens into their apps.</p>
<p>The supply of XinFin is fixed, long-term and non-inflationary.</p>
<p>In addition to the above, XinFin is an integral part of the XinFin Network network for a number of reasons.</p>
<ul>
<li>XinFin will be used to fund the development of XinFin Network and its ecosystem (XinFinScan, XinFinMater, xdcwallet, etc.).</li>
<li>XinFin will be used as a reward to incentivise the building of the XinFin Network engine/ecosystem.</li>
<li>XinFin will be used as a long-term, decentralized governance instrument of the XinFin Network network.</li>
</ul>

Masternodes and Stakers will receive block rewards.</p>
</div>
<div class="admonition quote">
<p class="admonition-title">What is XinFin circulating supply and total supply?</p>
<p>The initial circulating supply at genesis block is 55'000'000 but the current circulating supply is increasing every epoch.</p>

<p class="admonition-title">Will XinFin Network have inflation?</p>
<p>The total supply is fixed at 100 million XinFin in the first 8 years (non-inflationary).
17 million XinFin which are reserved as block rewards will have been all distributed after 8 years.
At that time, we are expecting that block rewards will come from the exchange fees.
But the Masternode Council can decide to increase the total supply by 0.5-1 million XinFin per year (which will be used as block rewards) (~small inflation, 0.5%-1% annually).</p>
</div>
<div class="admonition quote">

<div class="admonition quote">
<p class="admonition-title">Does XinFin Network have Masternodes? How do they work?</p>
<p>Yes, XinFin Network has a maximum of 150 Masternodes with Proof of Stake Voting (POSV) consensus for low transaction fee, and instant transaction confirmation.
Masternodes create, verify and validate new blocks in XinFinChain’s platform.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Masternode Candidates:</strong> Any account can deposit 50,000 XinFin using <a href="https://master.xinfin.org/">XinFinMaster</a> to become a masternode candidate.
A candidate can resign, but the tokens will be locked for the next 30 days (1,296,000 blocks) after the resignation.</li>
<li><strong>Becoming a Masternode:</strong> A candidate becomes a masternode when he/she belongs to the top 150 most voted candidates in each epoch.
A Masternode can resign, but the tokens will be locked for the next 30 days after the resignation.</li>
<li><strong>Rewards:</strong> The rewards a masternode receives in each epoch is proportional to the number of signatures it signs.
Masternodes will also receive fees from the XinFin Network DEX, which is planned for development in Q1 2019.</li>
</ul>
<p>XinFin Network masternodes started signing blocks and receiving block rewards with the Mainnet release in December 14th, 2018.</p>
</div>
<div class="admonition quote">
<p class="admonition-title">What is a masternode in the XinFin Network ecosystem?</p>
<p>A XinFin Network masternode is a server which uses its computing power to contribute to the network.
Its job is to create and sign blocks.
For this contribution to the network, masternodes receive rewards in the form of XinFin.</p>
<p>Masternodes are elected using the PoSV consensus via our governance dApp <a href="https://master.xinfin.org/">XinFinMaster</a></p>
</div>
<div class="admonition quote">
<p class="admonition-title">What are the incentives to run a masternode?</p>
<p>Masternodes contribute to the network and for this work they will receive a significant amount of block rewards, which will likely exceed the cost for running the infrastructure.
However, masternode owners need to invest in XinFin Network by depositing at least 50'000 XinFin, and stake them in the long term.</p>
<p>After the initial deposit, if the account does not become a masternode (has less votes than the top 150 most voted candidates), he will not receive rewards.
Therefore, candidates are incentivised to do as much as they can to signal their capability to support XinFin Network to get into top 150 most voted candidates.</p>
</div>
<div class="admonition quote">
<p class="admonition-title">How did you decide on 150 masternodes? Why did you decide to increase this from the initial 99?</p>
<p>The reason came from both decentralization consideration, and also scalability consideration.
In terms of decentralization, 150 is better than 99.
The more important consideration is the scalability.
We also increased the number of masternodes to better suit the sharding solution later.</p>
<p>Also 150 is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunbar%27s_number">Dunbar’s Number</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="admonition quote">
<p class="admonition-title">Where will the Masternode rewards come from? Will they be from the DEX?</p>
<p>The block rewards will come from a 17 million XinFin reserve for the next 8 years - this was decided since the genesis block.
Our <a href="https://docs.xinfin.org/wp-and-research/economics-paper/">Economics paper</a> lays out the number in detail.</p>
<p>And then later on, because we plan to have a built-in DEX, the revenues from the DEX will go to the Masternodes as well.</p>
</div>
<div class="admonition quote">
<p class="admonition-title">When are Masternode rewards paid out?</p>
<p>Masternode operators and stakers will receive rewards every epoch.
An epoch is a 900-block period of 2-second block time (~30 minutes). </p>
</div>
<div class="admonition quote">
<p class="admonition-title">How can I check my rewards?</p>
<p>You can check your masternode/staking rewards using xdcwallet.
Alternatively you can use XinFinMaster or XinFinScan.</p>
</div>
<div class="admonition quote">
<p class="admonition-title">How much rewards will Masternodes receive?</p>
<p>Each epoch consists of 900 blocks, which will reward a total of 250 XinFin in the first two years.
This amount of 250 XinFin will be divided to all of the Masternodes proportionally to the number of signatures they sign during the epoch.</p>
<p>Example: With only 25 Masternodes and equal performances, every masternode would be rewarded with 10 XinFin. With 125 Masternodes, each one would receive 2 XinFin per epoch.</p>
<p>Please, refer to our <a href="https://docs.xinfin.org/wp-and-research/economics-paper/">Economics paper</a> for more details about the masternodes reward.</p>
</div>
<div class="admonition quote">
<p class="admonition-title">How much reward from Masternodes will go to the Masternode infrastructure (node owner) and how much is for voters?</p>
<p>There is a reward sharing ratio among token holders and masternode who has been elected supported by the token holders.
The reward achieved by each Masternode will be divided into three portions:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Infrastructure Reward:</strong> The first portion of 40% called Infrastructure Reward goes to the Masternode operator.</li>
<li><strong>Staking Reward:</strong> The second portion of 50% called Staking Reward goes to the pool of all voters for that Masternode which is shared proportionally based on the token stake.
The Masternode also gets proportional rewards for his 50K XinFin initial deposit.</li>
<li><strong>Foundation Reward:</strong> The last portion of 10% called Foundation Reward goes to a special account controlled by the Masternode Foundation, which is run by the XinFin Network company initially. </li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="admonition quote">
<p class="admonition-title">What is the expected ROI for Masternodes and Stakers?</p>
<p>The rewards for every masternode will be dynamic and depending on multiple factors like: number of masternodes in the network, the efficiency signing blocks, the total number of votes on each masternode.
The most efficient masternodes signing blocks will receive higher rewards.</p>
<p>Please, refer to our <a href="https://docs.xinfin.org/wp-and-research/economics-paper/">Economics paper</a> for more details about the masternodes reward.
We discuss 3 possible scenarios with 50, 100 and 150 Masternodes; and different number of total votes.</p>
<p>One example is outlined below.</p>
<p>Scenario: 150 Masternodes, 12.5 million tokens voting (a total of 20 million token locked).</p>
<p>Reward achieved per epoch (900 blocks):</p>
<ul>
<li><code>By a Masternode = 0.6667 XinFin</code></li>
<li><code>By a Voter with 1K XinFin staked = 0.00625 XinFin</code></li>
</ul>
<p>Approximate reward achieved per week:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>By a Masternode = 224 XinFin</code></li>
<li><code>By a Voter with 1K XinFin staked = 2.1 XinFin</code></li>
</ul>
<p>Approximate reward achieved per year:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>By a Masternode = 11,680 XinFin</code></li>
<li><code>By a Voter with 1K XinFin staked = 109.5 XinFin (10.95% annually)</code></li>
<li><code>By a Voter with 50K XinFin staked = 5,475 XinFin</code>    </li>
<li><code>Total reward for a Masternode with a 50K XinFin deposit: 11,680 + 5,475 = 17,155 XinFin (34.31% annually)</code></li>
</ul>

<div class="admonition quote">
<p class="admonition-title">What is a masternode candidate? What is the difference between masternode candidate and masternode?</p>
<p>A Masternode Candidate is any node who deposited 50K XinFin and is listed on <a href="https://master.xinfin.org/">XinFinMaster</a>.</p>
<p>One Candidate only becomes a Masternode when he is in the top-150 most-voted masternode candidates in an epoch.
Only these elected masternodes will be able to sign blocks and receive block rewards.</p>
</div>
<div class="admonition quote">
<p class="admonition-title">How can I become a Masternode?</p>
<p>The first step to become a masternode, is becoming a masternode candidate.
To become a Masternode Candidate you need:</p>
<ul>
<li>to run XinFin Network software in a machine with certain minimal hardware requirements</li>
<li>to deposit 50’000 XinFin in a smart-contract via XinFinMaster</li>
</ul>
<p>The list of Masternode Candidates will be available on the governance DApp, <a href="https://master.xinfin.org/">XinFinMaster</a>.
The next step is to be elected as one of the top 150 most voted candidates. </p>
</div>
<div class="admonition quote">
<p class="admonition-title">Do I need to use my own computer to run a node?</p>
<p>We recommend using an IaaS ("cloud") provider of your choice (like Amazon AWS, Digital Ocean, Google Cloud GCE, Vultr, etc).
The machine must be directly facing internet (public IP, no NAT) and with 100% uptime.</p>
<p>If you have other production grade environment than cloud provider at your disposal, please tell us more about on our <a href="https://gitter.im/XinFin Network">Gitter</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="admonition quote">
<p class="admonition-title">Which are the hardware requirements to run a node?</p>
<p>Processing transactions is mostly CPU bound.
Therefore we recommend running CPU optimized servers.</p>
<ul>
<li>Directly facing internet (public IP, no NAT)</li>
<li>16 cores CPU</li>
<li>32GB of RAM</li>
<li>SSD storage</li>
</ul>
<p>We recommend using popular cloud providers as their reliability and uptime are close to 100%.
Those servers would be a good starting point:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>DigitalOcean:</strong> CPU optimized droplet 32GB/16CPU</li>
<li><strong>Amazon EC2:</strong> C5 instance</li>
<li><strong>Google Cloud Engine:</strong> n1-highcpu-16</li>
</ul>
<p>Setting up a masternode candidate on a weaker machine might result in poor performances, significantly impacting owner's rewards and the chain performance.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> If you are running a node in Testnet, 2CPU/8GB of RAM is sufficient.</p>
</div>
<div class="admonition quote">
<p class="admonition-title">How do Masternode Candidates become Masternodes?</p>
<p>Once you are a Masternode Candidate, you need the support of XinFin Network community in the form of votes.
The top 150 most voted candidates every period called epoch (900 blocks of 2-second block-time) will be promoted to Masternode.
This list will change dynamically every epoch.
Only the 150 masternodes elected will be able to sign blocks and will receive rewards in the form of XinFin. </p>

<p class="admonition-title">Do I need two wallets to run a Masternode?</p>
<p>It is recommended for security reasons.
You can create your wallet from wherever you want, the only rule being that you need two of them.
One for your masternode, and one to make the 50K deposit (this account will receive the rewards).</p>
</div>
<div class="admonition quote">
<p class="admonition-title">What is the 'coinbase address'?</p>
<p>'Coinbase address' is the public address used to run your node and register it to the system.</p>
<p>We recommend using two addresses when running your nodes.
The public address or 'coinbase address' will only receive transaction fees.
The private address is from where you make the initial 50K XinFin deposit and where the block rewards will be collected.</p>
</div>
<div class="admonition quote">
<p class="admonition-title">How can I create a public 'coinbase address' wallet? Is it only with xdcwallet for iOS and Android? Are there other options?</p>
<p>You need to create a wallet for the masternode public address.
This wallet does not need to contain any XinFin, think of it as a shell address.
You will then stake XinFin into the masternode address via your main XinFin wallet.</p>
<p>You can use the iOS and Android apps.
Also you can create wallets with Metamask, MyEtherWallet.</p>
<p>You can also use <a href="https://wallet.testnet.xinfin.org">https://wallet.testnet.xinfin.org</a> to create an empty wallet, then use it as coinbase address.</p>
</div>
<div class="admonition quote">
<p class="admonition-title">I noticed that we need another wallet for masternode with a different mnemonic. Assume we use a hardware wallet, we would need another hardware wallet with different mnemonic?</p>
<p>It is recommended to use a separate empty account for your masternode as it only receive transactions fees - what we call public or 'coinbase address' on the documentation.</p>
<p>The block rewards are sent to the account connected to XinFinMaster who make the initial deposit - the 'private' address.</p>
</div>
<div class="admonition quote">
<p class="admonition-title">Can I use the same address pair (tmn public address + initial deposit address) for all my nodes? Or I have to transfer tokens to another wallet and start the second node?</p>
<p>No.
Must use different public 'coinbase' addresses.
But you can use the same initial deposit ('private') address, then all rewards will be transferred to only one address.</p>
</div>
<div class="admonition quote">

<div class="admonition quote">
<p class="admonition-title">Why is a node flagged as 'Slashed'?</p>
<p>A masternode will be automatically slashed by the Slashing Mechanism if the node doesn't validate any block within an epoch.</p>
<p>Some reasons for this might be that the masternode does not have the correct XinFin Network software, lack of memory or masternode crashes due to the lack of e-maintenance and operation by the masternode owner.</p>
<p>A Slashed node will be 'kicked out' for the next 4 epochs.
At the 5th epoch after being slashed, the slashed masternode can go back to the candidate list.</p>

Your masternode will stop generating rewards and your funds will be locked for 30 days (1 296 000 blocks).
After the lockup period you will be able to withdraw your 50’000 XinFin deposit.</p>
</div>
<div class="admonition quote">
<p class="admonition-title">Can I close the node entirely, then start a new one with a totally separate coinbase address without being penalized?</p>

<div class="admonition quote">
<p class="admonition-title">What if I do not have enough XinFin for a masternode? Can I stake my coins?</p>
<p>Yes.
Token holders can stake XinFin and receive rewards.</p>
<p>To stake XinFin you need to vote for masternode candidates by sending XinFin to each candidates specific voting-address using the official governance d-App: XinFinMaster.`
The top-150 most voted candidates will become masternodes.
Token holders can also un-vote candidates, but the tokens will be locked for the next 96 epochs / 8,640 blocks (approx. 48 hours) after the un-voting.</p>
<p>Masternode token deposits, and all tokens used to vote for masternodes will enter the staking program, and earn block rewards in each epoch, plus any fees.
Tokens used to vote for candidates who do not become masternodes will not earn staking rewards.</p>

To vote, they must deposit XinFin in a smart-contract associated with the voted candidate.</p>
<p>The top-150 most-voted candidates will be promoted to masternode during the next epoch and will be able to sign blocks and collect rewards.
All the voters (stakers) who supported the elected masternodes will receive rewards proportional to the amount of XinFin voted.</p>
</div>
<div class="admonition quote">
<p class="admonition-title">How do I vote?</p>
<p>Any token holder can vote.
Login to XinFinMaster and then click 'Vote' on a node.

<div class="admonition quote">
<p class="admonition-title">How do I vote from my Ledger Nano S?</p>
<p>Plug in your Ledger and open the Ethereum App. Go to XinFinMaster.</p>
<p>Login in the top-right corner and select Ledger from the drop-down menu.</p>
<p>Change the HD path to <code>m/44'/60'/0'</code></p>
<p>You should see your XinFin balance.</p>
<p>To see a list of nodes click on the XinFinMaster homepage button - top left corner.
Next to each node should be a 'Vote' button.
When voting you will need to confirm transaction on your Ledger.</p>
</div>
<div class="admonition quote">
<p class="admonition-title">Can I stake for multiple masternodes via Ledger?</p>
<p>Yes, you can.</p>
</div>
<div class="admonition quote">
<p class="admonition-title">Ledger not working?</p>
<p>Upgrade your Ledger to the newest firmware.</p>
</div>
<div class="admonition quote">
<p class="admonition-title">Can I use Trezor to vote for masternodes?</p>
<p>Yes. XinFinMaster supports Trezor now.</p>
</div>
<div class="admonition quote">
<p class="admonition-title">What criteria must be considered when voting? Which masternode candidate should I vote for?</p>
<p>The most important criteria to maximize voter’s profit, the main points you should consider when voting, are the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Top-150 most voted:</strong> Your candidate must be one of the top-150 most-voted. If your candidate gets in the 151th most-voted place, it will not be promoted to masternode and you will earn zero rewards.</li>
<li><strong>Hardware, Performance:</strong> Powerful CPU, RAM, bandwidth, latency, etc so the node can work hard and receive high rewards</li>
<li><strong>Number of signed blocks:</strong> The more signed blocks per epoch, the higher rewards</li>
<li><strong>Time of last signed block:</strong> Verify that the masternode is active</li>
<li><strong>Total Capacity:</strong> Staking rewards are shared between all the masternode votes. Less voted masternodes are more profitable. 5K staked on a 50K-staked masternode will receive ten times more rewards than 5K staked on a 500K total staked masternode.</li>
<li><strong>Social Proof, Reputation:</strong> Masternodes managed by trusted companies that are for the long term, maintaining the masternode, updating hardware and software to last versions, fixing problems, etc.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="admonition quote">
<p class="admonition-title">How many Masternode Candidates can I vote for?</p>
<p>You can vote for as many candidates as you wish, splitting your XinFin.</p>
<p>Example: If you have 1'000 XinFin you can vote 500 XinFin for candidate A, 450 XinFin for candidate B, and 50 XinFin for candidate C.</p>
</div>
<div class="admonition quote">
<p class="admonition-title">What is the minimum amount to Stake?</p>
<p>The minimum amount to stake is 100 XinFin.</p>
</div>
<div class="admonition quote">
<p class="admonition-title">Which hardware-wallet can I use to vote?</p>
<p>You are able to use hardware wallets (Ledger, Trezor) with MyEtherWallet or Metamask.
You can also directly connect to the XinFin Network Mainnet with Ledger/Trezor and vote on <a href="https://master.xinfin.org/">XinFinMaster</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="admonition quote">
<p class="admonition-title">Is it possible to re-invest the XinFin earned and use it to continue voting?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
</div>
<div class="admonition quote">
<p class="admonition-title">Is there a way to stake the earned rewards automatically?</p>
<p>This is not supported currently.</p>
</div>
<div class="admonition quote">
<p class="admonition-title">What happens if the Masternode I voted for stops working? Will I get my XinFin back?</p>
<p>Yes. You can unvote that masternode and take your tokens back after 48h lock-up period.</p>
</div>
<div class="admonition quote">
<p class="admonition-title">How do I UnVote?</p>
<p>If you do not want to support a masternode you voted for, you can unvote it by clicking the ‘Unvote’ button on the masternode's page and enter the amount of XinFin you wish to unvote.</p>
<p>After unvoting, your XinFin are still locked in the smart contract for 96 epochs (approx. 48 hours) before you are able to withdraw.
When the lockup period is finished you need to click the ‘Withdraw’ button and the coins will appear again on your wallet.</p>
</div>
<div class="admonition quote">
<p class="admonition-title">How to withdraw after unvoting?</p>
<p>After unvoting, you need to wait until your XinFin is unlocked from the smart contract (96 epochs, approx. 48 hours).
Then you can go to XinFinMaster and click the 'Withdraw' button in your account page (the three vertical dots on the top-right) and choose which withdrawal you want to receive back your XinFin.</p>
<p>Note that you might see multiple withdrawals on your account page if you made multiple unvotes previously.</p>

<p class="admonition-title">What is the difference between XinFinX and a DeX?</p>
<p>XinFin Network's philosophy on decentralized exchanges is quite different from others.
In XinFin Network's design for decentralized exchanges, XinFinX is the core decentralized exchange protocol, which takes in charge the order matching and execution.
XinFinX is integrated into the core layer of the XinFin Network consensus. </p>
<p>A decentralized exchange (DEX) in XinFin Network's design for DEXs is a relayer that interacts with the underlying XinFinX protocol.
Typically, a relayer will send/receive trade orders to/from XinFinX which processes these trade orders. </p>
<p>XinFinDEX will be the first relayer in XinFin Network's decentralized exchange ecosystem.
We expect XinFinDex to be one of the most sophisticated Dex out there, consequently users who like the Dex experience will use XinFinDex.
XinFinDex will be the first to list any token running on top of XinFin Network together with well-known cryptocurrencies such as BTC and ETH, and have the best liquidity for new XinFin Network's tokens.</p>
<p>With XinFin Network almost zero-fee, 2-second confirmation and 2'000 transactions per second, all relayers interacting with XinFinX Protocol will be fully decentralized and very efficient.</p>
