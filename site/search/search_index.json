The objective of XinFin Network is to become a leading part of this phenomenon through seamlessly merging an ecosystem of applications with cryptographic tokens used by millions of mainstream users with a unique blockchain infrastructure architecture, allowing for fast, frictionless payment and a secure, decentralised, and trusted store of value. XinFin Network aims to be a public EVM-compatible blockchain with the following advantages: low transaction fee, fast confirmation time, double validation and randomization for security guarantees. XinFin Network envisions an ecosystem of different DApps running on the XinFin Network blockchain infrastructure. In particular, we propose a solution for solving the transaction processing performance bottleneck in Ethereum which hinders its adoption into industries, especially finance. More specifically, we are constructing an efficient and secured consensus protocol, which tackles the following main bottlenecks of classic blockchains: Efficiency: The small throughput of Bitcoin and Ethereum severely hinders a widespread adoption of such crypto- currencies. Confirmation times: Bitcoin takes on average 1 hour to confirm a transaction because the confirmation of a Bitcoin block requires 5 subsequent blocks created following it. While Ethereum uses a smaller block-time, the average confirmation time still remains relatively high, around 13 minutes. These long confirmation times hinder many important applications (especially smart contract applications). Fork Generation: The problem of fork chain consumes computational energy, time, and creates potential vulnerabilities for different types of attacks. In the newly published technical paper, XinFin Network proposes the Proof-of-Stake Voting (PoSV) consensus, which is a PoS-based blockchain protocol with a fair voting mechanism, rigorous security guarantees, and uniform probability eventually. The consensus has the following key novelties: Double Validation to strengthen security and reduce fork Randomization to guarantee the fair and prevent handshaking attack Fast confirmation time and efficient checkpoints for finality or rebase","title":"Introduction"},{"location":"Requirement/req/","text":"\ufeff On-Chain Governance for XinFin DPOS \u00b6 On-Chain Governance for XinFin DPOS Overview Built-in Public governance mechanism where any changes in network (update_proposal) will get approved by 2/3 of register_validator (Master-node holder) by voting_system to incorporate those changes in network.

XinFin Network is an innovative solution to the scalability problem of the Ethereum blockchain, and other current blockchain platforms. XinFin Network relies on a system of 21 Masternodes with Proof of Stake Voting (POSV) consensus that can support low transaction fees and 2-second transaction confirmation times. Security, stability and chain finality are guaranteed via novel techniques such as double validation, staking via smart-contracts and true randomization processes. XinFin Network supports all EVM-compatible smart-contracts, protocols, and atomic cross-chain token transfers. New scaling techniques such as sharding, EVM parallelisation, private-chain generation, hardware integration will be continuously researched and incorporated into XinFin Network's Masternode architecture. It will be an ideal scalable smart-contract public blockchain for decentralized apps, token issuances and token integrations for small and big businesses. What problem is XinFin Network aiming to solve? The problems that XinFin Network aims to solve can be summarized as follows: The network congestion on Ethereum (low transaction time) High transaction fees on Ethereum Most other blockchains are highly centralized and/or do not have interoperability with Ethereum system Blockchain has become one of the most disruptive technologies that enables many decentralized applications, including but not limited to cryptocurrencies, smart-contracts, voting and supply-chain management. Blockchain proponents have been trying to inject it into this Industry 4.0 revolution era. In order to reach this goal, the current blockchain infrastructure must at least be able to compete with many mainstream technologies, such as Visa and MasterCard processors in financial services. Nevertheless, the reality is disappointing: Bitcoin and Ethereum can only process around 7 and 15 transactions per second, respectively. Remember that, these numbers in Visa and MasterCard are around 5'000-6'000 transactions per second. XinFin Network is continuously working and researching several scaling solutions. Regarding on-chain scaling, Sharding and Proof-of-Stake-based consensus are of potential that can significantly improve transaction processing performance while trying to maintain security requirements of the system. XinFin Network supports low fee and 2-second transaction confirmation times. XinFin Network can currently process 2'000-5'000 transactions per second (TPS) and once sharding is enabled, XinFin Network is expected to reach 20'000-30'000 TPS. How does XinFin Network work? What is the architecture and consensus used? XinFin Network relies on a system of 150 Masternodes with Proof of Stake Voting (POSV) consensus that can support low fees (approx. 1/100 of that of Ethereum's) and 2-second transaction confirmation times. Security, stability and chain finality are guaranteed via novel techniques such as Double Validation, staking via smart-contracts and true randomization processes. Can you tell more about Proof of Stake Voting (PoSV)? What is it? At the heart of XinFin Network, the Proof-of-Stake Voting (PoSV) consensus enables XinFin Network as an EVM-compatible and scalable public blockchain, on which every Ethereum smart contract can be effectively run with almost instant transaction confirmation. PoSV features its Masternode architecture in which token holders deposit 50k XinFin to become a masternode candidate and receive votes from other token holders. The most voted masternode candidates are selected as masternodes for block creation within a period, called epoch. Each masternode takes its block creation in a round-robin manner every 2-second and follows the double validation technique for security reinforcement. A block is finalised if it is signed off by 3/4 masternodes. At the end of each epoch, the masternodes that have signed finalised blocks are rewarded. Stakers who voted for those masternodes will also be rewarded. What is Double Validation? Double Validation provides an additional trustless validation layer for security enhancement through a provable uniform distribution decentralized randomization. Specifically, when a block is created by a masternode, it must be verified by another masternode that is randomly selected among the set of masternodes before being added to the blockchain. Double validation strengthens XinFinchain\u2019s security, reduces fork and nothing-at-stake attacks, and makes XinFin Network unique among other Proof-of-Stake-based blockchains. What is an 'epoch'? An epoch is a 900-block period of 2-second block time starting from block #1 (900 blocks x 2s/block = around 1800s or ~30 minutes). Which scaling solutions will XinFin Network implement? Will you have sharding? XinFin Network solutions are based on on-chain scaling built into an architecture of 150 voted masternodes with our Proof-of-stake Voting (POSV) consensus protocol. We achieve 2-second block-time and almost instant transaction confirmation. To scale further our infrastructure, we have presented our Sharding proposal for uniquely integrating Sharding into our current architecture and consensus. The implementation of sharding is on-going and we will enable it in Q2 2019, after XinFin Network decentralized exchange (XinFinX) launch. Besides sharding, we are actively researching scalability solutions like EVM parallelization and Plasma. New scaling techniques such as sharding, EVM parallelisation, private-chain generation, hardware integration will be evaluated before being integrated into XinFin Network's masternode architecture. What is the current TPS? What is your targeted transaction speed and when do you think you can achieve that speed? XinFin Network supports low transaction fees (approx. 1/100 of that of Ethereum's) and 2-second transaction confirmation times. The mainnet with POSV Masternodes delivers 2'000 transactions per second (TPS). Once sharding is implemented by Q2 2019, we expect 20'000-30'000 TPS. XinFin Network team is continuously researching other scaling techniques to keep improving. What makes XinFin Network different? The unique point of XinFin Network comes from technology, the products and the ecosystem. Novel technology: includes Proof of Stake Voting consensus Build in governance D-app Double Validation and Randomization Sharding based on a stable masternode artichitecture This enables XinFin Network to achieve: Cheap transactions: approx. 1/100 of that of Ethereum 2000 TPS to handle a robust d-app and token ecosystem; TPS will be dramatically higher once our sharding solution is enabled (20k-30k TPS) 2 second block time for fast transactions EVM-compatibility allows for interoperability with Ethereum ecosystem. Our unique products XinFinScan: Shows all blocks, transactions, finality, smart contracts, D-Apps and token information XinFinMaster: Allows users to apply for a Masternode Candidate position; to vote for Masternodes and shows Masternode performance statistics xdcwallet: Securely store, send, receive XinFin and other tokens issued on XinFin Network; Allows users to vote and track rewards XinFinX: A secure and efficient relayer-masternode decentralized exchange protocol Our own ecosystem XinFin Network also is working vigorously on building its ecosystem and has sealed many partnerships from all fields such as agriculture, robotics, gaming, IT solution providers, advertising, pharmaceutical tracking, education and research, payment, communication, name service, food traceability, tourism etc such as TechInAsia, Kambria, Axie Infinity, Vnext, Farmatrust, TE-Food, Triip Protocol, Portal Network... How does XinFin Network compare with other available blockchain projects? Some of our competitors are EOS.IO, Casper FFG, Cardano, Tendermint, Lisk. We are doing a series of Medium posts on this matter. Some posts have been published, such as \"Blockchain comparison overview: EOS.IO, Casper FFG, Cardano, Tendermint and XinFinchain\" , a detailed comparison with EOS XinFinchain vs. EOS.IO: The battle of PoSV vs. DPoS or just some coincidence of design philosophy? , and a Comparison of PoS-voting based reward engines among XinFin Network, EOS and Lisk . The world is a pretty big place, and startups often kill themselves because they cannot make a desirable product, not because of the competition. At the moment, besides the core XinFin Network platform, we want to focus on a few quality Dapp use cases that can make a difference. Quality before quantity. Our core blockchain solution like the sharding proposal is of very high quality, and potentially better than multiple high profile attempts at scaling currently. The solution is also very unique to XinFin Network's Marsternode design, which will remain our competitive product advantage for a long time. There are also several other product solutions in design stage which also highly integrate with XinFinchain's overall design. These product innovations is one of the core competencies we have that make XinFinchain very unique compared to other big projects. We are doing our best to solve the scalability problem, maximize the TPS and stay strong in our target market. Which blockchain(s) are XinFin Network's main competitors? On the one hand, all base layer blockchains such as Ethereum, EOS, NEM, NEO, XinFin Network etc are competitors because app developers/token issuers will generally choose only one blockchain to work on. On the other hand, it is too early to focus on competition as it is more important to expand the whole blockchain ecosystem rather than to compete. XinFin Network has a unique position in which it adds value to the Ethereum ecosystem by addressing scalability and governance issues while keeping the same smart-contracts and general architecture. XinFin Network is EVM-compatible. What does that mean? EVM means Ethereum Virtual Machine. XinFin Network supports all EVM-compatible smart-contracts, protocols, and atomic cross-chain token transfers. This means that any smart-contract written in Ethereum protocol can be easily ported to XinFin Network. Any d-App written in Ethereum can be seamlessly ported to XinFin Network. Is XinFin Network a side-chain of Ethereum? XinFin Network has its own blockchain since XinFin Network Mainnet was launched in December 14th, 2018. Is XinFin Network compatible with Ethereum? Yes, any smart-contract written in Ethereum protocol can be easily ported to XinFin Network. This is one strength appealing to some dApp developers and some of our partners. Can developers make hybrid dApps using both Ethereum and XinFin Network in one single dApp? Yes, they can make an app, and deploy it to both Ethereum, and XinFin Network. It can be done relatively easy since XinFin Network supports EVM, and share a common architecture with Ethereum. How do you solve 'security problems' when using XinFin Network? In terms of security of consensus protocol, XinFin Network proposes Double Validation and Randomization to protect the system. The details of these techniques can be referred in our Technical paper . XinFin Network solves some consensus-related security aspects: Nothing-at-stake problem: This problem is commonly discussed in PoS-based blockchain consensus and just like 51% attacks in PoW. XinFin Network solves it by using Double Validation and Randomization. The details are shown in our technical paper. Long-range attacks: Attackers can try to recreate all blocks from a very far position to the current block. Attackers can do that because PoS-based consensus does not require extra-ordinary hashing power to re-write the whole blockchain. XinFin Network addresses by providing finality. Once a block is signed by at least 3/4 masternodes, it is consider irreversible, meaning that any attempt to re-write the blockchain history will be rejected. Censorship-resistance: Please refer to this medium article for more detailed analysis DDoS and spamming attacks: XinFin Network's transaction fee is not zero (even it is very low), attackers still require a significant amount of XinFin in order to flood the network for only a short time. How does XinFin Network defend against spamming attacks? XinFin Network has different measures to defend against spamming attacks. For instance, increasing transaction fees for smart contract creation is one of them. The min is 10 XinFin. Otherwise an error of smart contract creation cost is under allowance may show up.

The list of XinFin Network Products is as follows: XinFinScan, XinFinStats, XinFinMaster, xdcwallet; XinFinX. XinFin - Economics \u00b6 What is XinFin? Can you describe the functions and purposes of XinFin? XinFin is the native cryptocurrency of XinFin Network and will be the reserve cryptocurrency for all third-party apps running on XinFin Network. Being the protocol token for the XinFin Network infrastructure, XinFin will be needed by all parties utilising XinFin Network to build apps or issue and integrate cryptographic tokens into their apps. The supply of XinFin is fixed, long-term and non-inflationary. In addition to the above, XinFin is an integral part of the XinFin Network network for a number of reasons. XinFin will be used to fund the development of XinFin Network and its ecosystem (XinFinScan, XinFinMater, xdcwallet, etc.). XinFin will be used as a reward to incentivise the building of the XinFin Network engine/ecosystem. XinFin will be used as a long-term, decentralized governance instrument of the XinFin Network network. You can check our technical whitepaper for more details. Can I mine XDC? XDC is not mineable but mintable by masternodes. Masternodes are responsible for creating, verifying and finalizing the blocks created within a period, called epoch. Masternodes and Stakers will receive block rewards. What is XinFin circulating supply and total supply? The initial circulating supply at genesis block is 55'000'000 but the current circulating supply is increasing every epoch. After 8 years, XinFin total supply is fixed at 100'000'000 XDC. How is XinFin distributed? The token allocation is splitted as follows: 55 millions XinFin was already allocated after the token sale period; 12 millions XinFin are reserved for the team vested over the next 4 years; 16 millions XinFin are reserved for strategic partners and an ecosystem building fund; 17 millions XinFin are reserved as block rewards for the next 8 years How are block rewards distributed? 17 millions XinFin are reserved as block rewards for the next 8 years. 1st and 2nd year: 4 million XinFin annually 3rd, 4th and 5th year: 2 million XinFin annually 6th, 7th and 8th year: 1 million XinFin annually Will XinFin Network have inflation? The total supply is fixed at 100 million XinFin in the first 8 years (non-inflationary). 17 million XinFin which are reserved as block rewards will have been all distributed after 8 years. At that time, we are expecting that block rewards will come from the exchange fees. But the Masternode Council can decide to increase the total supply by 0.5-1 million XinFin per year (which will be used as block rewards) (~small inflation, 0.5%-1% annually). How often are block rewards paid out? Block rewards will be earnt every epoch, which lasts for 900 of two-second-block time (~30 minutes). Stakers will be also rewarded. If XinFin Network has zero fees, how can Masternodes get rewards? The block rewards will be emitted from a reserved fund with 17 million XinFin for the first 8 years. The block rewards are as follows: 1st and 2nd year: 4 million XinFin annually 3rd, 4th and 5th year: 2 million XinFin annually 6th, 7th and 8th year: 1 million XinFin annually We plan to have a built-in DEX, the revenues from the DEX will go to the Masternodes as well. After 8 years, the block rewards will come from the exchange fees. Also, the Masternode Council can decide to increase the total supply by 0.5-1 million XinFin per year (which will be used as block rewards). What is the price in presale and ICO? Presale Price: $0.2 ICO Price: $0.25 ( 0.0003125 ETH ) When will XinFin be listed on new exchanges? We do not discuss about exchange related questions due to the regulation. We will announce every exchange news on our official channels on due time. Is XinFin an ERC-20 token? Since Mainnet, XinFin has become the native coin of the XinFin Network blockchain. Where to store XDCE? How can I send XDCE to my wallet? You can store XinFin in xdcwallet, TrustWallet, MetaMask, MyEtherWallet, Ledger and Trezor. We recommend to store XDCE in xdcwallet. Please, read more details here: https://docs.xinfin.org/get-started/wallet/ Can I send XDCE directly from my MyEtherWallet? Yes. MyEtherWallet now has XinFin Network in the supported network list. XinFin holders then can send XDCE using MyEtherWallet. How to connect Metamask / MyEtherWallet with XinFin Network mainnet? The followings are information used for configuring Metamask to connect to XinFin Network Mainnet. RPC endpoint: https://rpc.xinfin.org Chain ID: 88 Symbol: XinFin Network Name: XinFin Network Mainnet XinFin Network is now supported by MyEtherWallet. All you need to do is to choose Network XinFin in the supported network list in MyEtherWallet. You can find the info about our Mainnet or Testnet on our Networks page. Also, you can find out more detailed information about how to use different wallet types to connect to XinFin Network Mainnet on Connect your wallet Where can I buy XinFin? (exchanges) You can trade XinFin on various exchanges. Take a look in the \"Exchanges\" section on this page of our main website. Masternodes \u00b6 Does XinFin Network have Masternodes? How do they work? Yes, XinFin Network has a maximum of 150 Masternodes with Proof of Stake Voting (POSV) consensus for low transaction fee, and instant transaction confirmation. Masternodes create, verify and validate new blocks in XinFinChain\u2019s platform. Masternode Candidates: Any account can deposit 50,000 XinFin using XinFinMaster to become a masternode candidate. A candidate can resign, but the tokens will be locked for the next 30 days (1,296,000 blocks) after the resignation. Becoming a Masternode: A candidate becomes a masternode when he/she belongs to the top 150 most voted candidates in each epoch. A Masternode can resign, but the tokens will be locked for the next 30 days after the resignation. Rewards: The rewards a masternode receives in each epoch is proportional to the number of signatures it signs. Masternodes will also receive fees from the XinFin Network DEX, which is planned for development in Q1 2019. XinFin Network masternodes started signing blocks and receiving block rewards with the Mainnet release in December 14th, 2018. What is a masternode in the XinFin Network ecosystem? A XinFin Network masternode is a server which uses its computing power to contribute to the network. Its job is to create and sign blocks. For this contribution to the network, masternodes receive rewards in the form of XinFin. Masternodes are elected using the PoSV consensus via our governance dApp XinFinMaster What are the incentives to run a masternode? Masternodes contribute to the network and for this work they will receive a significant amount of block rewards, which will likely exceed the cost for running the infrastructure. However, masternode owners need to invest in XinFin Network by depositing at least 50'000 XinFin, and stake them in the long term. After the initial deposit, if the account does not become a masternode (has less votes than the top 150 most voted candidates), he will not receive rewards. Therefore, candidates are incentivised to do as much as they can to signal their capability to support XinFin Network to get into top 150 most voted candidates. How did you decide on 150 masternodes? Why did you decide to increase this from the initial 99? The reason came from both decentralization consideration, and also scalability consideration. In terms of decentralization, 150 is better than 99. The more important consideration is the scalability. We also increased the number of masternodes to better suit the sharding solution later. Also 150 is Dunbar\u2019s Number . Where will the Masternode rewards come from? Will they be from the DEX? The block rewards will come from a 17 million XinFin reserve for the next 8 years - this was decided since the genesis block. Our Economics paper lays out the number in detail. And then later on, because we plan to have a built-in DEX, the revenues from the DEX will go to the Masternodes as well. When are Masternode rewards paid out? Masternode operators and stakers will receive rewards every epoch. An epoch is a 900-block period of 2-second block time (~30 minutes). How can I check my rewards? You can check your masternode/staking rewards using xdcwallet. Alternatively you can use XinFinMaster or XinFinScan. How much rewards will Masternodes receive? Each epoch consists of 900 blocks, which will reward a total of 250 XinFin in the first two years. This amount of 250 XinFin will be divided to all of the Masternodes proportionally to the number of signatures they sign during the epoch. Example: With only 25 Masternodes and equal performances, every masternode would be rewarded with 10 XinFin. With 125 Masternodes, each one would receive 2 XinFin per epoch. Please, refer to our Economics paper for more details about the masternodes reward. How much reward from Masternodes will go to the Masternode infrastructure (node owner) and how much is for voters? There is a reward sharing ratio among token holders and masternode who has been elected supported by the token holders. The reward achieved by each Masternode will be divided into three portions: Infrastructure Reward: The first portion of 40% called Infrastructure Reward goes to the Masternode operator. Staking Reward: The second portion of 50% called Staking Reward goes to the pool of all voters for that Masternode which is shared proportionally based on the token stake. The Masternode also gets proportional rewards for his 50K XinFin initial deposit. Foundation Reward: The last portion of 10% called Foundation Reward goes to a special account controlled by the Masternode Foundation, which is run by the XinFin Network company initially. What is the expected ROI for Masternodes and Stakers? The rewards for every masternode will be dynamic and depending on multiple factors like: number of masternodes in the network, the efficiency signing blocks, the total number of votes on each masternode. The most efficient masternodes signing blocks will receive higher rewards. Please, refer to our Economics paper for more details about the masternodes reward. We discuss 3 possible scenarios with 50, 100 and 150 Masternodes; and different number of total votes. One example is outlined below. Scenario: 150 Masternodes, 12.5 million tokens voting (a total of 20 million token locked). Reward achieved per epoch (900 blocks): By a Masternode = 0.6667 XinFin By a Voter with 1K XinFin staked = 0.00625 XinFin Approximate reward achieved per week: By a Masternode = 224 XinFin By a Voter with 1K XinFin staked = 2.1 XinFin Approximate reward achieved per year: By a Masternode = 11,680 XinFin By a Voter with 1K XinFin staked = 109.5 XinFin (10.95% annually) By a Voter with 50K XinFin staked = 5,475 XinFin Total reward for a Masternode with a 50K XinFin deposit: 11,680 + 5,475 = 17,155 XinFin (34.31% annually) Masternode Candidate \u00b6 What is a masternode candidate? What is the difference between masternode candidate and masternode? A Masternode Candidate is any node who deposited 50K XinFin and is listed on XinFinMaster . One Candidate only becomes a Masternode when he is in the top-150 most-voted masternode candidates in an epoch. Only these elected masternodes will be able to sign blocks and receive block rewards. How can I become a Masternode? The first step to become a masternode, is becoming a masternode candidate. To become a Masternode Candidate you need: to run XinFin Network software in a machine with certain minimal hardware requirements to deposit 50\u2019000 XinFin in a smart-contract via XinFinMaster The list of Masternode Candidates will be available on the governance DApp, XinFinMaster . The next step is to be elected as one of the top 150 most voted candidates. Do I need to use my own computer to run a node? We recommend using an IaaS (\"cloud\") provider of your choice (like Amazon AWS, Digital Ocean, Google Cloud GCE, Vultr, etc). The machine must be directly facing internet (public IP, no NAT) and with 100% uptime. If you have other production grade environment than cloud provider at your disposal, please tell us more about on our Gitter . Which are the hardware requirements to run a node? Processing transactions is mostly CPU bound. Therefore we recommend running CPU optimized servers. Directly facing internet (public IP, no NAT) 16 cores CPU 32GB of RAM SSD storage We recommend using popular cloud providers as their reliability and uptime are close to 100%. Those servers would be a good starting point: DigitalOcean: CPU optimized droplet 32GB/16CPU Amazon EC2: C5 instance Google Cloud Engine: n1-highcpu-16 Setting up a masternode candidate on a weaker machine might result in poor performances, significantly impacting owner's rewards and the chain performance. Note: If you are running a node in Testnet, 2CPU/8GB of RAM is sufficient. How do Masternode Candidates become Masternodes? Once you are a Masternode Candidate, you need the support of XinFin Network community in the form of votes. The top 150 most voted candidates every period called epoch (900 blocks of 2-second block-time) will be promoted to Masternode. This list will change dynamically every epoch. Only the 150 masternodes elected will be able to sign blocks and will receive rewards in the form of XinFin. Is there any guide on 'How to run a masternode from A to Z'? See this Medium post . Where can I find the latest masternode guide or the instructions for setting up a masternode? Find more details about tmn here: https://docs.xinfin.org/masternode/tmn/ What is the command to start a fullnode with 'tmn'? tmn start --name node_name --net mainnet --pkey your_private_key tmn is installed but just not in your path. See: https://docs.xinfin.org/masternode/tmn/#tmn-command-not-found I tried stopping the node using 'tmn stop', but after that I ran 'tmn status' it still says running. You can run tmn --debug stop and send the log to us. We will help you to investigate the issue. Do I need two wallets to run a Masternode? It is recommended for security reasons. You can create your wallet from wherever you want, the only rule being that you need two of them. One for your masternode, and one to make the 50K deposit (this account will receive the rewards). What is the 'coinbase address'? 'Coinbase address' is the public address used to run your node and register it to the system. We recommend using two addresses when running your nodes. The public address or 'coinbase address' will only receive transaction fees. The private address is from where you make the initial 50K XinFin deposit and where the block rewards will be collected. How can I create a public 'coinbase address' wallet? Is it only with xdcwallet for iOS and Android? Are there other options? You need to create a wallet for the masternode public address. This wallet does not need to contain any XinFin, think of it as a shell address. You will then stake XinFin into the masternode address via your main XinFin wallet. You can use the iOS and Android apps. Also you can create wallets with Metamask, MyEtherWallet. You can also use https://wallet.testnet.xinfin.org to create an empty wallet, then use it as coinbase address. I noticed that we need another wallet for masternode with a different mnemonic. Assume we use a hardware wallet, we would need another hardware wallet with different mnemonic? It is recommended to use a separate empty account for your masternode as it only receive transactions fees - what we call public or 'coinbase address' on the documentation. The block rewards are sent to the account connected to XinFinMaster who make the initial deposit - the 'private' address. Can I use the same address pair (tmn public address + initial deposit address) for all my nodes? Or I have to transfer tokens to another wallet and start the second node? No. Must use different public 'coinbase' addresses. But you can use the same initial deposit ('private') address, then all rewards will be transferred to only one address. I have finished all steps of setting up node. Why I don't see my node on XinFinMaster? You must apply to become a masternode candidate. Do I need to deposit the 50K XinFin before or after running 'tmn' in VPS? After. Your node must be fully synched before applying. How do I check the blockchain sync status from the node? You can watch the logs, but it is easier from the XinFinStats website or its eth.blockNumber API call. If the masternode owner deposits 60K XinFin instead of 50K on its own node, can it later on unstake the excess 10K? Yes, it can. How can I change my node's name? You can do it on XinFinMaster. Go to your masternode page on XinFinMaster, if you are logged in XinFinMaster with the owner account, you can click next to the masternode name to edit infos. My node status is 'Proposed', will it change status with next checkpoint? Yes, if you are in top-150 most voted. Why is a node flagged as 'Slashed'? A masternode will be automatically slashed by the Slashing Mechanism if the node doesn't validate any block within an epoch. Some reasons for this might be that the masternode does not have the correct XinFin Network software, lack of memory or masternode crashes due to the lack of e-maintenance and operation by the masternode owner. A Slashed node will be 'kicked out' for the next 4 epochs. At the 5th epoch after being slashed, the slashed masternode can go back to the candidate list. How do I update my Masternode to the newest version? Run this command: pip3 install -U tmn && tmn update && tmn start How many nodes I am allowed to run? As many as you can. How can I resign as Masternode? If you no longer want to be a masternode, you can resign on XinFinMaster. Your masternode will stop generating rewards and your funds will be locked for 30 days (1 296 000 blocks). After the lockup period you will be able to withdraw your 50\u2019000 XinFin deposit. Can I close the node entirely, then start a new one with a totally separate coinbase address without being penalized? No. Your old node will be penalized (50K initial deposit 30-day lockup) and your new node has to apply again. Is it possible to move a masternode later, like backup and start it from another IP address? Yes. What if I do not have enough XinFin for a masternode? Can I stake my coins? Yes. Token holders can stake XinFin and receive rewards. To stake XinFin you need to vote for masternode candidates by sending XinFin to each candidates specific voting-address using the official governance d-App: XinFinMaster.` The top-150 most voted candidates will become masternodes. Token holders can also un-vote candidates, but the tokens will be locked for the next 96 epochs / 8,640 blocks (approx. 48 hours) after the un-voting. Masternode token deposits, and all tokens used to vote for masternodes will enter the staking program, and earn block rewards in each epoch, plus any fees. Tokens used to vote for candidates who do not become masternodes will not earn staking rewards. Voter \u00b6 What are the voters incentives? Do voters get rewards too? Token voters should vote for the candidates who demonstrate strong support to the XinFin Network ecosystem. If strong candidates are voted to become masternodes, the network will be more powerful and the voters will earn more rewards. More information on the voting and reward mechanism in the Economics paper . Can you stake XinFin? Yes, you can stake XinFin and receive more XinFin coins as reward. How do I Stake? Just holding on my wallet? To stake in XinFin Network you must participate in the XinFin Network Masternode Election, voting for masternode candidate(s) using XinFinMaster to deposit your tokens in a voting smart-contract. Login to XinFinMaster and click 'Vote' on a node. How does XinFin Network Masternode Election work (POSV)? All token holders can vote XinFin on any candidates via XinFinMaster , where they can find a list of all masternode candidates. To vote, they must deposit XinFin in a smart-contract associated with the voted candidate. The top-150 most-voted candidates will be promoted to masternode during the next epoch and will be able to sign blocks and collect rewards. All the voters (stakers) who supported the elected masternodes will receive rewards proportional to the amount of XinFin voted. How do I vote? Any token holder can vote. Login to XinFinMaster and then click 'Vote' on a node. Then enter the amount of XinFin you want to vote (minimum is 100 XinFin). You vote by depositing (staking) tokens to a smart-contract associated with a masternode candidate. There are many ways to vote in XinFinMaster: Voting from xdcwallet. Voting from Ledger wallet Voting from Trezor wallet Voting via MetaMask (can be connected to your hardware wallets). Voting from TrustWallet Voting with your wallet's Private Key or MNEMONIC. How do I vote/stake from xdcwallet app on my phone? Please, read the following guide . Or watch this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tXp4WHl_sxY How do I vote from my Ledger Nano S? Plug in your Ledger and open the Ethereum App. Go to XinFinMaster. Login in the top-right corner and select Ledger from the drop-down menu. Change the HD path to m/44'/60'/0' You should see your XinFin balance. To see a list of nodes click on the XinFinMaster homepage button - top left corner. Next to each node should be a 'Vote' button. When voting you will need to confirm transaction on your Ledger. Can I stake for multiple masternodes via Ledger? Yes, you can. Ledger not working? Upgrade your Ledger to the newest firmware. Can I use Trezor to vote for masternodes? Yes. XinFinMaster supports Trezor now. What criteria must be considered when voting? Which masternode candidate should I vote for? The most important criteria to maximize voter\u2019s profit, the main points you should consider when voting, are the following: Top-150 most voted: Your candidate must be one of the top-150 most-voted. If your candidate gets in the 151th most-voted place, it will not be promoted to masternode and you will earn zero rewards. Hardware, Performance: Powerful CPU, RAM, bandwidth, latency, etc so the node can work hard and receive high rewards Number of signed blocks: The more signed blocks per epoch, the higher rewards Time of last signed block: Verify that the masternode is active Total Capacity: Staking rewards are shared between all the masternode votes. Less voted masternodes are more profitable. 5K staked on a 50K-staked masternode will receive ten times more rewards than 5K staked on a 500K total staked masternode. Social Proof, Reputation: Masternodes managed by trusted companies that are for the long term, maintaining the masternode, updating hardware and software to last versions, fixing problems, etc. How many Masternode Candidates can I vote for? You can vote for as many candidates as you wish, splitting your XinFin. Example: If you have 1'000 XinFin you can vote 500 XinFin for candidate A, 450 XinFin for candidate B, and 50 XinFin for candidate C. What is the minimum amount to Stake? The minimum amount to stake is 100 XinFin. Which hardware-wallet can I use to vote? You are able to use hardware wallets (Ledger, Trezor) with MyEtherWallet or Metamask. You can also directly connect to the XinFin Network Mainnet with Ledger/Trezor and vote on XinFinMaster . Is it possible to re-invest the XinFin earned and use it to continue voting? Yes. Is there a way to stake the earned rewards automatically? This is not supported currently. What happens if the Masternode I voted for stops working? Will I get my XinFin back? Yes. You can unvote that masternode and take your tokens back after 48h lock-up period. How do I UnVote? If you do not want to support a masternode you voted for, you can unvote it by clicking the \u2018Unvote\u2019 button on the masternode's page and enter the amount of XinFin you wish to unvote. After unvoting, your XinFin are still locked in the smart contract for 96 epochs (approx. 48 hours) before you are able to withdraw. When the lockup period is finished you need to click the \u2018Withdraw\u2019 button and the coins will appear again on your wallet. How to withdraw after unvoting? After unvoting, you need to wait until your XinFin is unlocked from the smart contract (96 epochs, approx. 48 hours). Then you can go to XinFinMaster and click the 'Withdraw' button in your account page (the three vertical dots on the top-right) and choose which withdrawal you want to receive back your XinFin. Note that you might see multiple withdrawals on your account page if you made multiple unvotes previously. Products \u00b6 XinFinScan \u00b6 What is XinFinScan? XinFinScan is our block explorer. It is pretty similar to EtherScan if you are already familiar with it. XinFinScan provides a user friendly, details and perfection-oriented user interface for XinFin Network block explorer. From a user perspective, XinFinScan brings XinFinChain\u2019s transparency to users, because all block, transaction, finality, smart contracts, dApp and token information are read from XinFin Network and shown to users. Furthermore, XinFinScan also offers technical visualisations and does useful statistics about the XinFin Network performance, token holders and other functionalities. What is a TxHash? How to check a TxHash? TxHash stands for 'transaction hash', and is also known as a transaction ID. An example of what a TxHash looks like: 0x838d33119b33e4519cb201e49bfc570ddc0fbdc6d9cf7038d8254a4de97f7112 To check a TxHash, follow the steps below: On XinFinScan , go to the search bar with the magnifying glass icon. Paste your transaction hash (TxHash) in the search bar and click the icon or press ENTER. Your transaction details will show up. Example: https://scan.testnet.xinfin.org/txs/0x838d33119b33e4519cb201e49bfc570ddc0fbdc6d9cf7038d8254a4de97f7112 XinFinStats \u00b6 What is XinFinStats? XinFinStats shows the various metrics regarding the current mainnet including the current number of masternodes, masternodes performance, current TPS, block-time, confirmation time, finality and other useful metrics. How much is the average time to see my node appear on XinFinStats? It should be less than a minute after tmn command is executed and finished. Stats page wasn't working and showed a 70-second block. What happened? The stats page is javascript code running in your browser. If your computer loses internet connection or the page is not active anymore for some reasons, the time will increase forever. In this case just refresh the page. XinFinMaster \u00b6 What is XinFinMaster? XinFinMaster , the 'Governance dApp', provides a professional UI that allows to see the list of masternodes and candidates, to deposit 50k XinFin to become a masternode candidate, to vote for masternodes, and to show masternode performance statistics. How do I login on XinFinMaster? Go to XinFinMaster. On the top-right corner click 'Login'. Then select how do you want to login: with xdcwallet, with Ledger, with Trezor, with Metamask, TrustWallet or Private Key/Mnemonic. What is the 'capacity' of a Candidate/Masternode? The capacity of a candidate is the 50K XinFin initial deposit plus the total amount of XinFin voted for that candidate. Which of these numbers on XinFinMaster will tell us which is a good performing node vs poorly performing? On XinFinMaster, click on a candidate to open the candidate page. Scroll down to 'Masternode Rewards'. You should look at 'Sign number' under Masternode Rewards to determine a good node or not. Masternodes will sign a maximum of 60 blocks per epoch. A good masternode will create around 60 sign transactions in that epoch. We also calculate the reward based on sign transactions number. What is a 'checkpoint'? For each iteration of 900 blocks (called epoch), a checkpoint block is created, which implements only reward works. The masternode, who takes turn in the circular and sequential order to create blocks, has to scan all of the created blocks in the epoch and count number of signatures. It is worth noting that token holders who unvote before the checkpoint block will not receive any shared reward in the Staking Reward portion. I want to stop running my node. If you don't want to run your masternode anymore, please remember to resign before shutting down the node. xdcwallet \u00b6 What is xdcwallet? Where can I download it? XinFin Wallet is the official mobile wallet for XinFin Network, aiming to store the XinFin native coin and tokens issued on XinFin Network. XinFin Wallet also allows users to vote for masternodes and track rewards. Users can download xdcwallet at App Store and Play Store . What tokens/coins does xdcwallet support? The current xdcwallet supports native XinFin on XinFin Network Mainnet. xdcwallet will support all tokens on XinFin Network platform in the future. How can I create a XinFin wallet? What are the options to create a XinFin wallet? You can create a XinFin wallet with the iOS app, the Android app, MyEtherWallet or Metamask. Can we vote on XinFinMaster using xdcwallet? Yes, xdcwallet can be used for voting/staking on XinFinMaster. How to Restore/Import Recovery Phrase into xdcwallet? Open xdcwallet, click 'Import Your Wallet', then type your recovery phrase.

TIP: Make sure to upgrade your xdcwallet to the latest version to see this feature. How do I protect my funds from scammers? Every wallet consists of two parts - public key and private key. xdcwallet stores your private key directly on your device. There are a couple of formats xdcwallet can display your private key in: Private key - an unencrypted collection of numbers and letters that unlocks access to your address on various blockchains Mnemonic phrase - 12 words used to secure your private key. Much easier to remember. No service should ever ask you for your private key. Anyone with your private key can access your wallet and have FULL CONTROL of your funds. I lost my backup, what do I do? You can always have multiple copies of your backup, if you think you can store it safely. Any valid backup (private key/ mnemonic) will get you to the most current state of your wallet. We at xdcwallet, don\u2019t have access to your wallet or your private key. We are not able to help you recover your backup if you lose your device and your backup. Please make sure you store your backup(s) in a safe place. Can I access cold storage wallet in 'view-only' mode with xdcwallet? The TrustWallet watch functionality allows users of cold storage wallets - Trezor, The xdcwallet watch functionality allows users of cold storage wallets: Ledger, KeepKey, or any other device - to access their wallet in a view-only mode. By ONLY importing a PUBLIC KEY, we ensure that no action can be performed inside the wallet, meaning no asset can be transferred out of the wallet or accessed in any way. That allows users to see how their crypto portfolio is performing while having their keys in a safe place. Here is how you can do it with xdcwallet: Open the xdcwallet Choose 'import a wallet' Select 'import your public key' -> Paste your address -> Import I sent my XinFin to a wrong address. What do I do? XinFin: m/44'/889'/0'/0 Can I switch from my existing wallet app like Metamask, MyEtherWallet, etc.?

XinFin Network's philosophy on decentralized exchanges is quite different from others. In XinFin Network's design for decentralized exchanges, XinFinX is the core decentralized exchange protocol, which takes in charge the order matching and execution. XinFinX is integrated into the core layer of the XinFin Network consensus. A decentralized exchange (DEX) in XinFin Network's design for DEXs is a relayer that interacts with the underlying XinFinX protocol. Typically, a relayer will send/receive trade orders to/from XinFinX which processes these trade orders. XinFinDEX will be the first relayer in XinFin Network's decentralized exchange ecosystem. We expect XinFinDex to be one of the most sophisticated Dex out there, consequently users who like the Dex experience will use XinFinDex. XinFinDex will be the first to list any token running on top of XinFin Network together with well-known cryptocurrencies such as BTC and ETH, and have the best liquidity for new XinFin Network's tokens. With XinFin Network almost zero-fee, 2-second confirmation and 2'000 transactions per second, all relayers interacting with XinFinX Protocol will be fully decentralized and very efficient. What is a Relayer? How can I set up one? A decentralized exchange (DEX) in XinFin Network's design for DEXs is a relayer that interacts with the underlying XinFinX protocol. Typically, a relayer will send/receive trade orders to/from XinFinX which processes these trade orders.","title":"FAQ"},{"location":"general/faq/#general","text":"","title":"General"},{"location":"general/faq/#xinfin-network","text":"What is XinFin Network? XinFin Network is an innovative solution to the scalability problem of the Ethereum blockchain, and other current blockchain platforms. XinFin Network relies on a system of 21 Masternodes with Proof of Stake Voting (POSV) consensus that can support low transaction fees and 2-second transaction confirmation times. Security, stability and chain finality are guaranteed via novel techniques such as double validation, staking via smart-contracts and true randomization processes. XinFin Network supports all EVM-compatible smart-contracts, protocols, and atomic cross-chain token transfers. New scaling techniques such as sharding, EVM parallelisation, private-chain generation, hardware integration will be continuously researched and incorporated into XinFin Network's Masternode architecture. It will be an ideal scalable smart-contract public blockchain for decentralized apps, token issuances and token integrations for small and big businesses. What problem is XinFin Network aiming to solve? The problems that XinFin Network aims to solve can be summarized as follows: The network congestion on Ethereum (low transaction time) High transaction fees on Ethereum Most other blockchains are highly centralized and/or do not have interoperability with Ethereum system Blockchain has become one of the most disruptive technologies that enables many decentralized applications, including but not limited to cryptocurrencies, smart-contracts, voting and supply-chain management. Blockchain proponents have been trying to inject it into this Industry 4.0 revolution era. In order to reach this goal, the current blockchain infrastructure must at least be able to compete with many mainstream technologies, such as Visa and MasterCard processors in financial services. Nevertheless, the reality is disappointing: Bitcoin and Ethereum can only process around 7 and 15 transactions per second, respectively. Remember that, these numbers in Visa and MasterCard are around 5'000-6'000 transactions per second. XinFin Network is continuously working and researching several scaling solutions. Regarding on-chain scaling, Sharding and Proof-of-Stake-based consensus are of potential that can significantly improve transaction processing performance while trying to maintain security requirements of the system. XinFin Network supports low fee and 2-second transaction confirmation times. XinFin Network can currently process 2'000-5'000 transactions per second (TPS) and once sharding is enabled, XinFin Network is expected to reach 20'000-30'000 TPS. How does XinFin Network work? What is the architecture and consensus used? XinFin Network relies on a system of 150 Masternodes with Proof of Stake Voting (POSV) consensus that can support low fees (approx. 1/100 of that of Ethereum's) and 2-second transaction confirmation times. Security, stability and chain finality are guaranteed via novel techniques such as Double Validation, staking via smart-contracts and true randomization processes. Can you tell more about Proof of Stake Voting (PoSV)? What is it? At the heart of XinFin Network, the Proof-of-Stake Voting (PoSV) consensus enables XinFin Network as an EVM-compatible and scalable public blockchain, on which every Ethereum smart contract can be effectively run with almost instant transaction confirmation. PoSV features its Masternode architecture in which token holders deposit 50k XinFin to become a masternode candidate and receive votes from other token holders. The most voted masternode candidates are selected as masternodes for block creation within a period, called epoch. Each masternode takes its block creation in a round-robin manner every 2-second and follows the double validation technique for security reinforcement. A block is finalised if it is signed off by 3/4 masternodes. At the end of each epoch, the masternodes that have signed finalised blocks are rewarded. Stakers who voted for those masternodes will also be rewarded. What is Double Validation? Double Validation provides an additional trustless validation layer for security enhancement through a provable uniform distribution decentralized randomization. Specifically, when a block is created by a masternode, it must be verified by another masternode that is randomly selected among the set of masternodes before being added to the blockchain. Double validation strengthens XinFinchain\u2019s security, reduces fork and nothing-at-stake attacks, and makes XinFin Network unique among other Proof-of-Stake-based blockchains. What is an 'epoch'? An epoch is a 900-block period of 2-second block time starting from block #1 (900 blocks x 2s/block = around 1800s or ~30 minutes). Which scaling solutions will XinFin Network implement? Will you have sharding? XinFin Network solutions are based on on-chain scaling built into an architecture of 150 voted masternodes with our Proof-of-stake Voting (POSV) consensus protocol. We achieve 2-second block-time and almost instant transaction confirmation. To scale further our infrastructure, we have presented our Sharding proposal for uniquely integrating Sharding into our current architecture and consensus. The implementation of sharding is on-going and we will enable it in Q2 2019, after XinFin Network decentralized exchange (XinFinX) launch. Besides sharding, we are actively researching scalability solutions like EVM parallelization and Plasma. New scaling techniques such as sharding, EVM parallelisation, private-chain generation, hardware integration will be evaluated before being integrated into XinFin Network's masternode architecture. What is the current TPS? What is your targeted transaction speed and when do you think you can achieve that speed? XinFin Network supports low transaction fees (approx. 1/100 of that of Ethereum's) and 2-second transaction confirmation times. The mainnet with POSV Masternodes delivers 2'000 transactions per second (TPS). Once sharding is implemented by Q2 2019, we expect 20'000-30'000 TPS. XinFin Network team is continuously researching other scaling techniques to keep improving. What makes XinFin Network different? The unique point of XinFin Network comes from technology, the products and the ecosystem. Novel technology: includes Proof of Stake Voting consensus Build in governance D-app Double Validation and Randomization Sharding based on a stable masternode artichitecture This enables XinFin Network to achieve: Cheap transactions: approx. 1/100 of that of Ethereum 2000 TPS to handle a robust d-app and token ecosystem; TPS will be dramatically higher once our sharding solution is enabled (20k-30k TPS) 2 second block time for fast transactions EVM-compatibility allows for interoperability with Ethereum ecosystem. Our unique products XinFinScan: Shows all blocks, transactions, finality, smart contracts, D-Apps and token information XinFinMaster: Allows users to apply for a Masternode Candidate position; to vote for Masternodes and shows Masternode performance statistics xdcwallet: Securely store, send, receive XinFin and other tokens issued on XinFin Network; Allows users to vote and track rewards XinFinX: A secure and efficient relayer-masternode decentralized exchange protocol Our own ecosystem XinFin Network also is working vigorously on building its ecosystem and has sealed many partnerships from all fields such as agriculture, robotics, gaming, IT solution providers, advertising, pharmaceutical tracking, education and research, payment, communication, name service, food traceability, tourism etc such as TechInAsia, Kambria, Axie Infinity, Vnext, Farmatrust, TE-Food, Triip Protocol, Portal Network... How does XinFin Network compare with other available blockchain projects? Some of our competitors are EOS.IO, Casper FFG, Cardano, Tendermint, Lisk. We are doing a series of Medium posts on this matter. Some posts have been published, such as \"Blockchain comparison overview: EOS.IO, Casper FFG, Cardano, Tendermint and XinFinchain\" , a detailed comparison with EOS XinFinchain vs. EOS.IO: The battle of PoSV vs. DPoS or just some coincidence of design philosophy? , and a Comparison of PoS-voting based reward engines among XinFin Network, EOS and Lisk . The world is a pretty big place, and startups often kill themselves because they cannot make a desirable product, not because of the competition. At the moment, besides the core XinFin Network platform, we want to focus on a few quality Dapp use cases that can make a difference. Quality before quantity. Our core blockchain solution like the sharding proposal is of very high quality, and potentially better than multiple high profile attempts at scaling currently. The solution is also very unique to XinFin Network's Marsternode design, which will remain our competitive product advantage for a long time. There are also several other product solutions in design stage which also highly integrate with XinFinchain's overall design. These product innovations is one of the core competencies we have that make XinFinchain very unique compared to other big projects. We are doing our best to solve the scalability problem, maximize the TPS and stay strong in our target market. Which blockchain(s) are XinFin Network's main competitors? On the one hand, all base layer blockchains such as Ethereum, EOS, NEM, NEO, XinFin Network etc are competitors because app developers/token issuers will generally choose only one blockchain to work on. On the other hand, it is too early to focus on competition as it is more important to expand the whole blockchain ecosystem rather than to compete. XinFin Network has a unique position in which it adds value to the Ethereum ecosystem by addressing scalability and governance issues while keeping the same smart-contracts and general architecture. XinFin Network is EVM-compatible. What does that mean? EVM means Ethereum Virtual Machine. XinFin Network supports all EVM-compatible smart-contracts, protocols, and atomic cross-chain token transfers. This means that any smart-contract written in Ethereum protocol can be easily ported to XinFin Network. Any d-App written in Ethereum can be seamlessly ported to XinFin Network. Is XinFin Network a side-chain of Ethereum? XinFin Network has its own blockchain since XinFin Network Mainnet was launched in December 14th, 2018. Is XinFin Network compatible with Ethereum? Yes, any smart-contract written in Ethereum protocol can be easily ported to XinFin Network. This is one strength appealing to some dApp developers and some of our partners. Can developers make hybrid dApps using both Ethereum and XinFin Network in one single dApp? Yes, they can make an app, and deploy it to both Ethereum, and XinFin Network. It can be done relatively easy since XinFin Network supports EVM, and share a common architecture with Ethereum. How do you solve 'security problems' when using XinFin Network? In terms of security of consensus protocol, XinFin Network proposes Double Validation and Randomization to protect the system. The details of these techniques can be referred in our Technical paper . XinFin Network solves some consensus-related security aspects: Nothing-at-stake problem: This problem is commonly discussed in PoS-based blockchain consensus and just like 51% attacks in PoW. XinFin Network solves it by using Double Validation and Randomization. The details are shown in our technical paper. Long-range attacks: Attackers can try to recreate all blocks from a very far position to the current block. Attackers can do that because PoS-based consensus does not require extra-ordinary hashing power to re-write the whole blockchain. XinFin Network addresses by providing finality. Once a block is signed by at least 3/4 masternodes, it is consider irreversible, meaning that any attempt to re-write the blockchain history will be rejected. Censorship-resistance: Please refer to this medium article for more detailed analysis DDoS and spamming attacks: XinFin Network's transaction fee is not zero (even it is very low), attackers still require a significant amount of XinFin in order to flood the network for only a short time. How does XinFin Network defend against spamming attacks? XinFin Network has different measures to defend against spamming attacks. For instance, increasing transaction fees for smart contract creation is one of them. The min is 10 XinFin. Otherwise an error of smart contract creation cost is under allowance may show up.","title":"XinFin Network"},{"location":"general/faq/#company","text":"Where is XinFin Network registered?

The supply of XinFin is fixed, long-term and non-inflationary. In addition to the above, XinFin is an integral part of the XinFin Network network for a number of reasons. XinFin will be used to fund the development of XinFin Network and its ecosystem (XinFinScan, XinFinMater, xdcwallet, etc.). XinFin will be used as a reward to incentivise the building of the XinFin Network engine/ecosystem. XinFin will be used as a long-term, decentralized governance instrument of the XinFin Network network. You can check our technical whitepaper for more details. Can I mine XDC? XDC is not mineable but mintable by masternodes. Masternodes are responsible for creating, verifying and finalizing the blocks created within a period, called epoch. Masternodes and Stakers will receive block rewards. What is XinFin circulating supply and total supply? The initial circulating supply at genesis block is 55'000'000 but the current circulating supply is increasing every epoch. After 8 years, XinFin total supply is fixed at 100'000'000 XDC. How is XinFin distributed? The token allocation is splitted as follows: 55 millions XinFin was already allocated after the token sale period; 12 millions XinFin are reserved for the team vested over the next 4 years; 16 millions XinFin are reserved for strategic partners and an ecosystem building fund; 17 millions XinFin are reserved as block rewards for the next 8 years How are block rewards distributed? 17 millions XinFin are reserved as block rewards for the next 8 years. 1st and 2nd year: 4 million XinFin annually 3rd, 4th and 5th year: 2 million XinFin annually 6th, 7th and 8th year: 1 million XinFin annually Will XinFin Network have inflation? The total supply is fixed at 100 million XinFin in the first 8 years (non-inflationary). 17 million XinFin which are reserved as block rewards will have been all distributed after 8 years. At that time, we are expecting that block rewards will come from the exchange fees. But the Masternode Council can decide to increase the total supply by 0.5-1 million XinFin per year (which will be used as block rewards) (~small inflation, 0.5%-1% annually). How often are block rewards paid out? Block rewards will be earnt every epoch, which lasts for 900 of two-second-block time (~30 minutes). Stakers will be also rewarded. If XinFin Network has zero fees, how can Masternodes get rewards? The block rewards will be emitted from a reserved fund with 17 million XinFin for the first 8 years. The block rewards are as follows: 1st and 2nd year: 4 million XinFin annually 3rd, 4th and 5th year: 2 million XinFin annually 6th, 7th and 8th year: 1 million XinFin annually We plan to have a built-in DEX, the revenues from the DEX will go to the Masternodes as well. After 8 years, the block rewards will come from the exchange fees. Also, the Masternode Council can decide to increase the total supply by 0.5-1 million XinFin per year (which will be used as block rewards). What is the price in presale and ICO? Presale Price: $0.2 ICO Price: $0.25 ( 0.0003125 ETH ) When will XinFin be listed on new exchanges? We do not discuss about exchange related questions due to the regulation.

How do they work? Yes, XinFin Network has a maximum of 150 Masternodes with Proof of Stake Voting (POSV) consensus for low transaction fee, and instant transaction confirmation. Masternodes create, verify and validate new blocks in XinFinChain\u2019s platform. Masternode Candidates: Any account can deposit 50,000 XinFin using XinFinMaster to become a masternode candidate. A candidate can resign, but the tokens will be locked for the next 30 days (1,296,000 blocks) after the resignation. Becoming a Masternode: A candidate becomes a masternode when he/she belongs to the top 150 most voted candidates in each epoch. A Masternode can resign, but the tokens will be locked for the next 30 days after the resignation. Rewards: The rewards a masternode receives in each epoch is proportional to the number of signatures it signs. Masternodes will also receive fees from the XinFin Network DEX, which is planned for development in Q1 2019. XinFin Network masternodes started signing blocks and receiving block rewards with the Mainnet release in December 14th, 2018. What is a masternode in the XinFin Network ecosystem? A XinFin Network masternode is a server which uses its computing power to contribute to the network. Its job is to create and sign blocks. For this contribution to the network, masternodes receive rewards in the form of XinFin. Masternodes are elected using the PoSV consensus via our governance dApp XinFinMaster What are the incentives to run a masternode? Masternodes contribute to the network and for this work they will receive a significant amount of block rewards, which will likely exceed the cost for running the infrastructure. However, masternode owners need to invest in XinFin Network by depositing at least 50'000 XinFin, and stake them in the long term. After the initial deposit, if the account does not become a masternode (has less votes than the top 150 most voted candidates), he will not receive rewards. Therefore, candidates are incentivised to do as much as they can to signal their capability to support XinFin Network to get into top 150 most voted candidates. How did you decide on 150 masternodes? Why did you decide to increase this from the initial 99? The reason came from both decentralization consideration, and also scalability consideration. In terms of decentralization, 150 is better than 99. The more important consideration is the scalability. We also increased the number of masternodes to better suit the sharding solution later. Also 150 is Dunbar\u2019s Number . Where will the Masternode rewards come from? Will they be from the DEX? The block rewards will come from a 17 million XinFin reserve for the next 8 years - this was decided since the genesis block. Our Economics paper lays out the number in detail. And then later on, because we plan to have a built-in DEX, the revenues from the DEX will go to the Masternodes as well. When are Masternode rewards paid out? Masternode operators and stakers will receive rewards every epoch. An epoch is a 900-block period of 2-second block time (~30 minutes). How can I check my rewards? You can check your masternode/staking rewards using xdcwallet. Alternatively you can use XinFinMaster or XinFinScan. How much rewards will Masternodes receive? Each epoch consists of 900 blocks, which will reward a total of 250 XinFin in the first two years. This amount of 250 XinFin will be divided to all of the Masternodes proportionally to the number of signatures they sign during the epoch. Example: With only 25 Masternodes and equal performances, every masternode would be rewarded with 10 XinFin. With 125 Masternodes, each one would receive 2 XinFin per epoch. Please, refer to our Economics paper for more details about the masternodes reward. How much reward from Masternodes will go to the Masternode infrastructure (node owner) and how much is for voters? There is a reward sharing ratio among token holders and masternode who has been elected supported by the token holders. The reward achieved by each Masternode will be divided into three portions: Infrastructure Reward: The first portion of 40% called Infrastructure Reward goes to the Masternode operator. Staking Reward: The second portion of 50% called Staking Reward goes to the pool of all voters for that Masternode which is shared proportionally based on the token stake. The Masternode also gets proportional rewards for his 50K XinFin initial deposit. Foundation Reward: The last portion of 10% called Foundation Reward goes to a special account controlled by the Masternode Foundation, which is run by the XinFin Network company initially. What is the expected ROI for Masternodes and Stakers? The rewards for every masternode will be dynamic and depending on multiple factors like: number of masternodes in the network, the efficiency signing blocks, the total number of votes on each masternode. The most efficient masternodes signing blocks will receive higher rewards. Please, refer to our Economics paper for more details about the masternodes reward. We discuss 3 possible scenarios with 50, 100 and 150 Masternodes; and different number of total votes. One example is outlined below. Scenario: 150 Masternodes, 12.5 million tokens voting (a total of 20 million token locked). Reward achieved per epoch (900 blocks): By a Masternode = 0.6667 XinFin By a Voter with 1K XinFin staked = 0.00625 XinFin Approximate reward achieved per week: By a Masternode = 224 XinFin By a Voter with 1K XinFin staked = 2.1 XinFin Approximate reward achieved per year: By a Masternode = 11,680 XinFin By a Voter with 1K XinFin staked = 109.5 XinFin (10.95% annually) By a Voter with 50K XinFin staked = 5,475 XinFin Total reward for a Masternode with a 50K XinFin deposit: 11,680 + 5,475 = 17,155 XinFin (34.31% annually)","title":"Masternodes"},{"location":"general/faq/#masternode-candidate","text":"What is a masternode candidate? What is the difference between masternode candidate and masternode? A Masternode Candidate is any node who deposited 50K XinFin and is listed on XinFinMaster . One Candidate only becomes a Masternode when he is in the top-150 most-voted masternode candidates in an epoch. Only these elected masternodes will be able to sign blocks and receive block rewards. How can I become a Masternode? The first step to become a masternode, is becoming a masternode candidate. To become a Masternode Candidate you need: to run XinFin Network software in a machine with certain minimal hardware requirements to deposit 50\u2019000 XinFin in a smart-contract via XinFinMaster The list of Masternode Candidates will be available on the governance DApp, XinFinMaster . The next step is to be elected as one of the top 150 most voted candidates. Do I need to use my own computer to run a node? We recommend using an IaaS (\"cloud\") provider of your choice (like Amazon AWS, Digital Ocean, Google Cloud GCE, Vultr, etc). The machine must be directly facing internet (public IP, no NAT) and with 100% uptime. If you have other production grade environment than cloud provider at your disposal, please tell us more about on our Gitter . Which are the hardware requirements to run a node? Processing transactions is mostly CPU bound. Therefore we recommend running CPU optimized servers. Directly facing internet (public IP, no NAT) 16 cores CPU 32GB of RAM SSD storage We recommend using popular cloud providers as their reliability and uptime are close to 100%. Those servers would be a good starting point: DigitalOcean: CPU optimized droplet 32GB/16CPU Amazon EC2: C5 instance Google Cloud Engine: n1-highcpu-16 Setting up a masternode candidate on a weaker machine might result in poor performances, significantly impacting owner's rewards and the chain performance. Note: If you are running a node in Testnet, 2CPU/8GB of RAM is sufficient. How do Masternode Candidates become Masternodes? Once you are a Masternode Candidate, you need the support of XinFin Network community in the form of votes. The top 150 most voted candidates every period called epoch (900 blocks of 2-second block-time) will be promoted to Masternode. This list will change dynamically every epoch. Only the 150 masternodes elected will be able to sign blocks and will receive rewards in the form of XinFin. Is there any guide on 'How to run a masternode from A to Z'? See this Medium post . Where can I find the latest masternode guide or the instructions for setting up a masternode? Find more details about tmn here: https://docs.xinfin.org/masternode/tmn/ What is the command to start a fullnode with 'tmn'? tmn start --name node_name --net mainnet --pkey your_private_key tmn is installed but just not in your path. See: https://docs.xinfin.org/masternode/tmn/#tmn-command-not-found I tried stopping the node using 'tmn stop', but after that I ran 'tmn status' it still says running. You can run tmn --debug stop and send the log to us. We will help you to investigate the issue. Do I need two wallets to run a Masternode? It is recommended for security reasons. You can create your wallet from wherever you want, the only rule being that you need two of them. One for your masternode, and one to make the 50K deposit (this account will receive the rewards). What is the 'coinbase address'? 'Coinbase address' is the public address used to run your node and register it to the system. We recommend using two addresses when running your nodes. The public address or 'coinbase address' will only receive transaction fees. The private address is from where you make the initial 50K XinFin deposit and where the block rewards will be collected. How can I create a public 'coinbase address' wallet? Is it only with xdcwallet for iOS and Android? Are there other options? You need to create a wallet for the masternode public address. This wallet does not need to contain any XinFin, think of it as a shell address. You will then stake XinFin into the masternode address via your main XinFin wallet. You can use the iOS and Android apps. Also you can create wallets with Metamask, MyEtherWallet. You can also use https://wallet.testnet.xinfin.org to create an empty wallet, then use it as coinbase address. I noticed that we need another wallet for masternode with a different mnemonic. Assume we use a hardware wallet, we would need another hardware wallet with different mnemonic? It is recommended to use a separate empty account for your masternode as it only receive transactions fees - what we call public or 'coinbase address' on the documentation. The block rewards are sent to the account connected to XinFinMaster who make the initial deposit - the 'private' address. Can I use the same address pair (tmn public address + initial deposit address) for all my nodes? Or I have to transfer tokens to another wallet and start the second node? No. Must use different public 'coinbase' addresses. But you can use the same initial deposit ('private') address, then all rewards will be transferred to only one address. I have finished all steps of setting up node. Why I don't see my node on XinFinMaster? You must apply to become a masternode candidate. Do I need to deposit the 50K XinFin before or after running 'tmn' in VPS? After. Your node must be fully synched before applying. How do I check the blockchain sync status from the node? You can watch the logs, but it is easier from the XinFinStats website or its eth.blockNumber API call. If the masternode owner deposits 60K XinFin instead of 50K on its own node, can it later on unstake the excess 10K? Yes, it can. How can I change my node's name? You can do it on XinFinMaster. Go to your masternode page on XinFinMaster, if you are logged in XinFinMaster with the owner account, you can click next to the masternode name to edit infos. My node status is 'Proposed', will it change status with next checkpoint? Yes, if you are in top-150 most voted. Why is a node flagged as 'Slashed'? A masternode will be automatically slashed by the Slashing Mechanism if the node doesn't validate any block within an epoch. Some reasons for this might be that the masternode does not have the correct XinFin Network software, lack of memory or masternode crashes due to the lack of e-maintenance and operation by the masternode owner. A Slashed node will be 'kicked out' for the next 4 epochs. At the 5th epoch after being slashed, the slashed masternode can go back to the candidate list. How do I update my Masternode to the newest version? Run this command: pip3 install -U tmn && tmn update && tmn start How many nodes I am allowed to run? As many as you can. How can I resign as Masternode? If you no longer want to be a masternode, you can resign on XinFinMaster. Your masternode will stop generating rewards and your funds will be locked for 30 days (1 296 000 blocks). After the lockup period you will be able to withdraw your 50\u2019000 XinFin deposit. Can I close the node entirely, then start a new one with a totally separate coinbase address without being penalized? No. Your old node will be penalized (50K initial deposit 30-day lockup) and your new node has to apply again. Is it possible to move a masternode later, like backup and start it from another IP address? Yes. What if I do not have enough XinFin for a masternode? Can I stake my coins? Yes. Token holders can stake XinFin and receive rewards. To stake XinFin you need to vote for masternode candidates by sending XinFin to each candidates specific voting-address using the official governance d-App: XinFinMaster.` The top-150 most voted candidates will become masternodes. Token holders can also un-vote candidates, but the tokens will be locked for the next 96 epochs / 8,640 blocks (approx. 48 hours) after the un-voting. Masternode token deposits, and all tokens used to vote for masternodes will enter the staking program, and earn block rewards in each epoch, plus any fees. Tokens used to vote for candidates who do not become masternodes will not earn staking rewards.","title":"Masternode Candidate"},{"location":"general/faq/#voter","text":"What are the voters incentives? Do voters get rewards too? Token voters should vote for the candidates who demonstrate strong support to the XinFin Network ecosystem. If strong candidates are voted to become masternodes, the network will be more powerful and the voters will earn more rewards. More information on the voting and reward mechanism in the Economics paper . Can you stake XinFin? Yes, you can stake XinFin and receive more XinFin coins as reward. How do I Stake? Just holding on my wallet? To stake in XinFin Network you must participate in the XinFin Network Masternode Election, voting for masternode candidate(s) using XinFinMaster to deposit your tokens in a voting smart-contract. Login to XinFinMaster and click 'Vote' on a node. How does XinFin Network Masternode Election work (POSV)? All token holders can vote XinFin on any candidates via XinFinMaster , where they can find a list of all masternode candidates. To vote, they must deposit XinFin in a smart-contract associated with the voted candidate. The top-150 most-voted candidates will be promoted to masternode during the next epoch and will be able to sign blocks and collect rewards. All the voters (stakers) who supported the elected masternodes will receive rewards proportional to the amount of XinFin voted. How do I vote? Any token holder can vote. Login to XinFinMaster and then click 'Vote' on a node. Then enter the amount of XinFin you want to vote (minimum is 100 XinFin). You vote by depositing (staking) tokens to a smart-contract associated with a masternode candidate. There are many ways to vote in XinFinMaster: Voting from xdcwallet. Voting from Ledger wallet Voting from Trezor wallet Voting via MetaMask (can be connected to your hardware wallets). Voting from TrustWallet Voting with your wallet's Private Key or MNEMONIC. How do I vote/stake from xdcwallet app on my phone? Please, read the following guide . Or watch this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tXp4WHl_sxY How do I vote from my Ledger Nano S? Plug in your Ledger and open the Ethereum App. Go to XinFinMaster. Login in the top-right corner and select Ledger from the drop-down menu. Change the HD path to m/44'/60'/0' You should see your XinFin balance. To see a list of nodes click on the XinFinMaster homepage button - top left corner. Next to each node should be a 'Vote' button. When voting you will need to confirm transaction on your Ledger. Can I stake for multiple masternodes via Ledger? Yes, you can. Ledger not working? Upgrade your Ledger to the newest firmware. Can I use Trezor to vote for masternodes? Yes. XinFinMaster supports Trezor now. What criteria must be considered when voting? Which masternode candidate should I vote for? The most important criteria to maximize voter\u2019s profit, the main points you should consider when voting, are the following: Top-150 most voted: Your candidate must be one of the top-150 most-voted. If your candidate gets in the 151th most-voted place, it will not be promoted to masternode and you will earn zero rewards. Hardware, Performance: Powerful CPU, RAM, bandwidth, latency, etc so the node can work hard and receive high rewards Number of signed blocks: The more signed blocks per epoch, the higher rewards Time of last signed block: Verify that the masternode is active Total Capacity: Staking rewards are shared between all the masternode votes. Less voted masternodes are more profitable. 5K staked on a 50K-staked masternode will receive ten times more rewards than 5K staked on a 500K total staked masternode. Social Proof, Reputation: Masternodes managed by trusted companies that are for the long term, maintaining the masternode, updating hardware and software to last versions, fixing problems, etc. How many Masternode Candidates can I vote for? You can vote for as many candidates as you wish, splitting your XinFin. Example: If you have 1'000 XinFin you can vote 500 XinFin for candidate A, 450 XinFin for candidate B, and 50 XinFin for candidate C. What is the minimum amount to Stake? The minimum amount to stake is 100 XinFin. Which hardware-wallet can I use to vote? You are able to use hardware wallets (Ledger, Trezor) with MyEtherWallet or Metamask. You can also directly connect to the XinFin Network Mainnet with Ledger/Trezor and vote on XinFinMaster . Is it possible to re-invest the XinFin earned and use it to continue voting? Yes. Is there a way to stake the earned rewards automatically? This is not supported currently. What happens if the Masternode I voted for stops working? Will I get my XinFin back? Yes. You can unvote that masternode and take your tokens back after 48h lock-up period. How do I UnVote? If you do not want to support a masternode you voted for, you can unvote it by clicking the \u2018Unvote\u2019 button on the masternode's page and enter the amount of XinFin you wish to unvote. After unvoting, your XinFin are still locked in the smart contract for 96 epochs (approx. 48 hours) before you are able to withdraw. When the lockup period is finished you need to click the \u2018Withdraw\u2019 button and the coins will appear again on your wallet. How to withdraw after unvoting? After unvoting, you need to wait until your XinFin is unlocked from the smart contract (96 epochs, approx. 48 hours). Then you can go to XinFinMaster and click the 'Withdraw' button in your account page (the three vertical dots on the top-right) and choose which withdrawal you want to receive back your XinFin.

Which of these numbers on XinFinMaster will tell us which is a good performing node vs poorly performing? On XinFinMaster, click on a candidate to open the candidate page. Scroll down to 'Masternode Rewards'. You should look at 'Sign number' under Masternode Rewards to determine a good node or not. Masternodes will sign a maximum of 60 blocks per epoch. A good masternode will create around 60 sign transactions in that epoch. We also calculate the reward based on sign transactions number. What is a 'checkpoint'? For each iteration of 900 blocks (called epoch), a checkpoint block is created, which implements only reward works. The masternode, who takes turn in the circular and sequential order to create blocks, has to scan all of the created blocks in the epoch and count number of signatures. It is worth noting that token holders who unvote before the checkpoint block will not receive any shared reward in the Staking Reward portion. I want to stop running my node.

XinFinX is integrated into the core layer of the XinFin Network consensus. A decentralized exchange (DEX) in XinFin Network's design for DEXs is a relayer that interacts with the underlying XinFinX protocol. Typically, a relayer will send/receive trade orders to/from XinFinX which processes these trade orders. XinFinDEX will be the first relayer in XinFin Network's decentralized exchange ecosystem. We expect XinFinDex to be one of the most sophisticated Dex out there, consequently users who like the Dex experience will use XinFinDex.

XinFin's blockchain is a combination of permissioned and public chains that can nicely address security and scalability. XinFin Hybrid Blockchain platform has matured through continuous development and improvements. XinFin's Consensus Mechanism XinFin removed traditional high electrical power consumption based mining mechanism called PoW (Proof of Work). Instead XinFin adopted an improved consensus methodology called PoS (Proof of Stake), and is now slowly moving towards Delegated Proof of Stake (DPoS). To understand behind XinFin's decision to go for DPoW, we need to discuss briefly about the consensus mechanisms. What is Consensus and how PoS, and DPoS are better than PoW Consensus means a general agreement which is an important component of blockchain technology. Instead of keeping the accounts in a centralized computing machine, as in a bank or centralized online payment system, cryptocurrency uses distributed ledgers or blockchains to record information. A general agreement is needed to record information, such as the balance of every address, transactions, etc. on the blockchain. Proof of Work or PoW relies on solving a cryptographic puzzle repetitively over all the nodes of the network. PoW involves burning very high amount of electrical energy. Proof of Stake doesn't need computers for repetitive solving of the cryptographic puzzle. Insead of miners, PoS requires some validators who will lock some of their crypto coins as stake or deposit. Anybody who holds crypto tokens can become a validator by processing a special type of transaction to lock their crypto fund. A group of validators takes part to propose and vote on the next block, and the weight of each validator's vote depends on the size of its stake. When the validators discover a block which they think can be added to the blockchain, they will validate it by placing a bet on it. The validators will get a reward proportionate to their bets. How Delegated Proof of Stake works Delegated Proof-of-Stake (DPoS) is more efficient than PoS consensus mechanism. DPoS uses a reputation system and real-time voting to achieve consensus. The members of the network vote to elect trusted representatives called block producers or witnesses to create blocks in a round robin manner. The voters own number of votes proportional to the number of tokens they own on the network, which is their stake. The voters may also delegate their voting power to another member to cast vote on their behalf. The elected block producers or the witnesses are rewarded for validation of the transactions for the next block. i) Block producers are elected by the voters and are limited in numbers who can sign and create blocks. ii) Block validators are the full nodes who verify that the blocks created by the block producers follow the consensus rule. The main difference between DPoS and PoS is in the consensus mechanism of DPoS. The community members have more rights in governance of the network. Pros and cons of Delegated Proof of Stake In DPoS consensus, only the elected witnesses or the block producers can create the blocks. The transactions are permitted only within the limited number of witnesses. Therefore, DPoS helps to make processing faster, reduce cost and improve scaling. The elected witnesses are regularly monitored. If they are found to be malicious, i.e. try to censor transactions or double spend, the voters can fire a witness by not voting them the next round. But there could be a problem. One or few members may convince others to vote them. If someone can manage to convince more than 51% of the voting power, then they can control almost everything in the network. That can result in a semi centralized control over the blockchain network which is highly against the philosophy blockchain. XinFin prefers DPoS because of speed, cost and scalability Since DPoS is more democratic, faster, efficient and effective to scale, XinFin naturally preferred DPoS to PoS.","title":"POW Replaced with DPOS"},{"location":"get-started/Setupmn/","text":"1.Set up Master Node \u00b6 Prerequisite Operating System : Ubuntu 16.04 64-bit or higher Should be facing internet directly with public IP & without NAT Tools: Git, Docker, Docker Compose Network Ports Following network ports need to be open for the nodes to communicate. 8545 TCP - RPC 30303 TCP/UDP - XDC How to Setup Masternode ? 0.

DPOS leverages the power of stakeholder approval voting to resolve consensus issues in a fair and democratic way. The Self KYC feature added in XinFin DPoS is more enterprise and regulator friendly. Definitions DPoS: Delegated Proof of Stake: a mechanism for the selection of network Validators by coin holders delegating their votes Validator: (usually denoted L) a node on the network responsible for producing and validating blocks. Nominator: a coin holder who stakes and delegates their coins to one or more Validators. Epoch: (usually denoted \ud835\udc41) corresponds to \ud835\udc3f\u2208\u2115 blocks: it is a cycle of a few blocks in which Validators create blocks in turn. Voting \u00b6 Any network participant will be able to vote for eligible Validators. 1.Staking Users can stake their coins by sending them to the deposit function on the staking contract. The staked amount must be larger than an amount MIN_STAKE The user will have to wait for 2 epochs (epoch N+2) before being able to vote for a delegate. 2.Delegating After 2 epochs, a Nominator can vote for a Validator with the staked coins. The vote will be effective in the epoch N+2, N being the current epoch. A new vote can be cast every 2 epochs. In this version, the entire stake must be voted to a single Validator. If a user wants to delegate to multiple Validators they can split their stake amongst several accounts which can then individually register as Nominators. 3.Withdrawal Nominators should be able to withdraw their stake. First, they must call delegate to remove their vote. After a specified number of epochs WITHDRAWAL_PERIOD the funds are unlocked and withdraw function on the smart contract can be called with a withdrawal address. Validators Registration \u00b6 Any network participant will be able to register as a Validator. A specified value REGISTRATION_VALUE (in the native token) will be sent to a registerfunction on the contract. It will be burnt in order to limit the number of participants. The validator is required to add KYC document at the time of staking XDC token. A hard limit to the total number of registered Validators MAX_REGISTERED_VALIDATORSshould be specified. Any Validator registering will have to wait for the beginning of epoch N+2(current epoch being N) to be eligible. A Validator\u2019s total stake must be greater than the MIN_TOTAL_STAKE in order for it to be eligible. The top validators(by a total stake) in a given epoch are chosen as the Active Validator Set: those Validators that produce blocks in the next epoch. KYC Compliance: We would like to add Know your customer (KYC) identification as it falls under the responsibility of financial institution and/or regulated company. Validator needs to upload self KYC document and this document will be visible on the open public network. Choosing Validators \u00b6 choose L Validators for a certain epoch N Balanced staked This version of the DPoS contract should balance all the stakes by finding the minimum staked for all eligible Validators (eg. take the top 1000 Validators) and balance all the Validators stakes by refunding the users the contributions that overflowed the stake. For example, if the minimum stake is S, we want to balance all stakes to S. If a Validator has S+100 stakes because of 3 contributions: \ud835\udc46\u221210, 5 and 100, then the last nominator will be refunded 95. In this model, an epoch would be of the maximum number of Validators allowed, eg. 1,001 (+/- an hour on a 4-seconds block time chain). Rewards \u00b6 Rewards are assigned via the Rewards Contract Rewards for active Validators are calculated as a percentage of total stake, VALIDATOR_REWARD. Nominators would also need to be rewarded to incentivize them to stake. There are a couple of options here: * The reward contract pays directly out to nominators, minus a fee payed the Validator, which could be specified when registering. * The Validator is responsible for calculating/paying out the rewards. This could be done by allowing the Validators to register their own Reward Contract when registering. Fork Perversion, Malicious or Double Spends: \u00b6 To prevent fork, we add a feature to revalidate transaction. Every transaction will have 2 signatures. One signature will be by block creator and the other signature will be by block verifier (both separate validator). So the block verifier will check for malicious or double spends etc. Slashing \u00b6 In order for the network to be secure, misbehaviours must be detected and punished. Off-chain: Off-chain detection of misbehaviour is easier to implement and can be used for tricky misbehaviour detections. In the contract, there will be a reportBenign method (part of the Validator Set Contract) that only Validators can call, passing a message and a block-number, and a slashing will execute if more than 2/3 of the Validators agree on the misbehaviour. These might include but are not limited to: Validators consistently propagating blocks late __ Validators being offline for more than 24 hours. It could slash a portion of the stakes, eg. only 4% On-chain: A slashing condition that can be verified on-chain is that a Validator signed-off 2 blocks with the same step (equivocation). Anyone could call this reportMalicious method with the right data, being the two signatures of the Validator, and the message signed, which would contain the step of the blocks. This method would thus include an RLP decoder. We could also detect if a Validator hasn\u2019t signed any block for the past 256 blocks on-chain, by challenging the Validator to submit the block he signed along with the signature. However, only the last 256 block hashes are available in the EVM, so it might be limited in this context of around 1,000-blocks epochs. There may be other on-chain slashable conditions.

Wallet Client: Wallet-cli is XDC Network\u2019s command-line wallet. Developers can use wallet-cli to post and deploy contracts on the MainNet as well as execute other operations. Smart Contract Development At this point, we recommend Remix as the coding environment for compiling and testing during the early stages. We present a simple example of contract code of data access to illustrate the process of compiling, deployment, and debugging. 1.Initiate the Private Chain: Make sure that the private chain in the prerequisite has been successfully deployed by checking if log message \u201cProduce block successfully\u201d of persistent block generation appears. 2.Develop Smart Contracts: Copy the code mentioned above to Remix to compile and debug. Make sure that logic of the code is correct, and the code itself is bug-free. 3.Compile in SimpleWebCompiler: The compiler of XDC is slightly different from that of Ethereum and is still integrating with Remix. Therefore, we are providing a temporary way of acquiring ABI and ByteCode instead of acquiring them directly from Remix. Copy the code above to SImpleWebCompiler and click the Compile button to attain ABI and ByteCode. 4.Deploy Smart Contract via Wallet-cli : Download Wallet-Cli and compile on it. Initiate Wallet-Cli Command to initiate the wallet-CLI After initiation, input the command interactively to the portal. Import the private key and inquire if the remaining balance is correct. Note: Developers can make the change in config.conf if they need to connect to a different node or interface.

DPOS concentrates block production in the hands of few semi-trusted entities in order to achieve more scalability than Proof of Work(PoW) or other Proof of Stake blockchains. Common Terms \u00b6 Nominator: A coin holder who stakes or delegates their coin to one or more validator. Validator: A semi-trusted entity responsible for validating and producing blocks. Epoch: A cycle of few blocks in which validator nodes create blocks in turn. Elections: In Delegated Proof of Stake (DPoS) anyone can participate in Validator (Block Producer) elections and those who hold the network token are able to cast votes to one or more Validator (Block Producers) candidates. Votes are weighted by the voter\u2019s stake and the Validators (Block Producers) candidates who receive a maximum number of votes become Validator (Block Producer). Users can also delegate their voting power to some other user, who can then vote on their behalf. Validator (Block Producer) can be voted in or out anytime so the threat of loss of income becomes a major incentive against bad behaviour. Token holder votes are tallied after a specific time or after each epoch. Why DPOS? \u00b6 Scalability Blocks can be propagated through the network much more efficiently. And blocks can be produced more consistently and reliably in a much shorter time frame. Moreover, finality can be reached as soon as \u2154 of the block producer has confirmed a transaction. 1.Network Infrastructure In DPoS users have control over who will provide the infrastructure unlike PoW and PoS, where users have no choice on validators. In DPoS, validators can be thought of as employees of users(nominators) and can be fired for not performing their duties. 2.On-Chain Governance DPoS is a liquid form of democracy where voting power canbe allocated to other participants and votes can be changed at any time. While block producers are the primary use case, but token holder voting can be conducted on different things like monetary policy, development funding and many more. 3.Self-Funding Through Inflation In DPoS, unlike PoS or PoW where miners getrewards for validating a block, inflation is used to pay block producers as well as to fund the development of platform itself. Attack Vectors \u00b6 1.Exploit Low Voter Turnout This problem exists in almost all PoS protocols, as the participants who show up and actually vote are really less. Voting is done by whales, exchanges and wallet providers. Although one good thing in DPoS is that, tokens can delegate voting power and still retain all of their utility. 2.Bribing Attacks It is a case where Validators (Block Producers) pay for their votes, they pay a small percentage of their earning per block. Although it may be good for some people, in the long term it will harm as the Validators who would do this wouldn\u2019t be able to scale up their systems and hence the block production will be slowed down. To tackle these attacks there is a voting decay concept where freshly cast votes are considered full while other votes will slowly decay until they have a minimal impact after 2 years. This will encourage participation and slowly discount those who just cast their votes once. 3.Block Producers Collude The main problem this can cause is a delay in the transaction and double spends. Although these situations are highly unlikely. Conclusion \u00b6 Delegated Proof of Stake(DPoS) is an elegant, robust and practically proven solution to the scalability issues of Blockchain. Although, DPoS does compromise decentralization in some sense, and it is up to token holders to monitor the health of the system, watch for bad behaviour and decide upon what makes for sufficient decentralization. It still solves the scalability and safety issues in Blockchain.

In an ideal world, a hybrid blockchain will mean controlled access and freedom at the same time. The hybrid blockchain is distinguishable from the fact that they are not open to everyone, but still offers blockchain features such as integrity, transparency, and security. As usual, Hybrid blockchain is entirely customizable. The members of the hybrid blockchain can decide who can take participation in the blockchain or which transactions are made public. This brings the best of both worlds and ensures that a company can work with their stakeholders in the best possible way. Benifits: \u00b6 Works in a closed ecosystem: The number one advantage of hybrid blockchain is its ability to work in a closed ecosystem. That means that companies or organizations don\u2019t have to worry about getting their information leaked when taking advantage of blockchain technology. Changes the rules when needed: Companies thrive on change. The good news about hybrid blockchain is that they need to change rules. However, the nature of the change depends on what the hybrid blockchain is trying to do. However, don\u2019t expect to change data or modify transactions in a hybrid system that handles land registry or user identity for verification purposes. Protecting from 51% attack: Hybrid blockchain are immune to a 51% attack as hackers cannot have access to the network to carry out the attack. Protecting privacy while still communicating with the outer world: Even though private blockchain is best for privacy-related issues. However, they are limited when it comes to communicating with the outer world. Many companies may want to keep privacy, but also need to configure their blockchain so that they can communicate with all their shareholders including the public. Low transaction cost: Another added benefit of using hybrid blockchain is to have a low transaction cost. Transactions are bound to be cheap as it requires few nodes to verify them. The most powerful nodes in the network make it easy to verify the transaction which may take thousands of nodes in public blockchain. The transaction fees can reduce to even 0.01$ per transaction.","title":"Hybrid Blockchain"},{"location":"get-started/hybblock/#benifits","text":"Works in a closed ecosystem: The number one advantage of hybrid blockchain is its ability to work in a closed ecosystem.

These nodes communicate using persistent protocols in order to create and validate transactions. There are three broader categories of functionality one such node may have. These pieces of functionality are provided as services, and one node may run several of them. Notary: Nodes running a notary service witness state spends and have the final say in whether a transaction is a double-spend or not Oracle: Network services that link the ledger to the outside world by providing facts that affect the validity of transactions Regular node: All nodes have a vault and may start protocols communicating with other nodes, notaries and oracles and evolve their private ledger Setting up your own network Certificates Every node in a given Corda network must have an identity certificate signed by the network\u2019s root CA. See Network permissioning for more information. Configuration A node can be configured by adding/editing node.conf in the node\u2019s directory. For details see Node configuration. An example configuration: myLegalName : \"O=Bank A,L=London,C=GB\" keyStorePassword : \"cordacadevpass\" trustStorePassword : \"trustpass\" dataSourceProperties : { dataSourceClassName : org.h2.jdbcx.JdbcDataSource \"dataSource.url\" : \"jdbc:h2:file:\"${baseDirectory}\"/persistence\" \"dataSource.user\" : sa \"dataSource.password\" : \"\"} p2pAddress : \"my-corda-node:10002\" rpcSettings = { useSsl = false standAloneBroker = false address : \"my-corda-node:10003\" adminAddress : \"my-corda-node:10004\" } webAddress : \"localhost:10004\" rpcUsers : [ { username=user1, password=letmein, permissions=[ StartFlow.net.corda.protocols.CashProtocol ] } ] devMode : true // certificateSigningService : \"https://testnet.certificate.corda.net\" The most important fields regarding network configuration are: p2pAddress: This specifies a host and port to which Artemis will bind for messaging with other nodes. Note that the address bound will NOT be my-corda-node, but rather :: (all addresses on all network interfaces). The hostname specified is the hostname that must be externally resolvable by other nodes in the network . In the above configuration this is the resolvable name of a machine in a VPN. rpcAddress: The address to which Artemis will bind for RPC calls. webAddress: The address the webserver should bind. Note that the port must be distinct from that of p2pAddress and rpcAddress if they are on the same machine. Bootstrapping the network The nodes see each other using the network map. This is a collection of statically signed node-info files, one for each node in the network. Most production deployments will use a highly available, secure distribution of the network map via HTTP. For test deployments where the nodes (at least initially) reside on the same filesystem, these node-info files can be placed directly in the node\u2019s additional-node-infos directory from where the node will pick them up and store them in its local network map cache. The node generates its own node-info file on startup. In addition to the network map, all the nodes on a network must use the same set of network parameters. These are a set of constants which guarantee interoperability between nodes. The HTTP network map distributes the network parameters which the node downloads automatically. In the absence of this the network parameters must be generated locally. This can be done with the network bootstrapper. This is a tool that scans all the node configurations from a common directory to generate the network parameters file which is copied to the nodes\u2019 directories. It also copies each node\u2019s node-info file to every other node so that they can all transact with each other. The bootstrapper tool can be built with the command: gradlew buildBootstrapperJar The resulting jar can be found in tools/bootstrapper/build/libs/ To use it, create a directory containing a node.conf file for each node you want to create. Then run the following command: java -jar network-bootstrapper.jar <nodes-root-dir For example running the command on a directory containing these files : . +-- notary.conf // The notary's node.conf file +-- partya.conf // Party A's node.conf file +-- partyb.conf // Party B's node.conf file Would generate directories containing three nodes: notary, partya and partyb. This tool only bootstraps a network. It cannot dynamically update if a new node needs to join the network or if an existing one has changed something in their node-info, e.g. their P2P address. For this the new node-info file will need to be placed in the other nodes\u2019 additional-node-infos directory. A simple way to do this is to use rsync. However, if it\u2019s known beforehand the set of nodes that will eventually the node folders can be pregenerated in the bootstrap and only started when needed. Whitelisting Contracts If you want to create a Zone whitelist (see API: Contract Constraints), you can pass in a list of CorDapp jars: `java -jar network-bootstrapper.jar The CorDapp jars will be hashed and scanned for Contract classes. By default the tool would generate a file named whitelist.txt containing an entry for each contract with the hash of the jar. For example: net.corda.finance.contracts.asset.Obligation:decd098666b9657314870e192ced0c3519c2c9d395507a238338f8d003929de8 net.corda.finance.contracts.asset.Cash:decd098666b9657314870e192ced0c3519c2c9d395507a238338f8d003929de9 These will be added to the NetworkParameters.whitelistedContractImplementations. See Network Map. This means that by default the Network bootstrapper tool will whitelist all contracts found in all passed CorDapps. In case there is a whitelist.txt file in the root dir already, the tool will append the new jar hashes or contracts to it. The zone operator will maintain this whitelist file, and, using the tool, will append new versions of CorDapps to it. Warning The zone operator must ensure that this file is append only. If the operator removes hashes from the list, all transactions pointing to that version will suddenly fail the constraint verification, and the entire chain is compromised. If a contract is removed from the whitelist, then all states created from that moment on will be constrained by the HashAttachmentConstraint. Note: In future releases, we will provider a tamper-proof way of maintaining the contract whitelist. For fine-grained control of constraints, in case multiple contracts live in the same jar, the tool reads from another file:exclude_whitelist.txt, which contains a list of contracts that should not be whitelisted, and thus default to the very restrictive: HashAttachmentConstraint For example: net.corda.finance.contracts.asset.Cash net.corda.finance.contracts.asset.CommercialPaper Starting the nodes You may now start the nodes in any order. You should see a banner, some log lines and eventually Node started up and registered, indicating that the node is fully started. In terms of process management there is no prescribed method. You may start the jars by hand or perhaps use systemd and friends. Logging Only a handful of important lines are printed to the console. For details/diagnosing problems check the logs. Logging is standard log4j2 and may be configured accordingly. Logs are by default redirected to files in NODE_DIRECTORY/logs/. Connecting to the nodes Once a node has started up successfully you may connect to it as a client to initiate protocols/query state etc. Depending on your network setup you may need to tunnel to do this remotely. See the Using the client RPC API on how to establish an RPC link. Sidenote: A client is always associated with a single node with a single identity, which only sees their part of the ledger.","title":"Build with XinFin Hybrid Network"},{"location":"get-started/hybnet/#xinfin-private-quorumfork","text":"Prerequisite Operating System: Ubuntu 16.04 64-bit or higher Tools: Docker, Docker Compose Hardware: CPU : 24 RAM : 08GB HDD : 500GB Network Ports Following network ports need to be open for the nodes to communicate 21001-2100* TCP/UDP GETH 22001-2200* TCP RPC 23001-2300* TCP RAFT 9001-900* TCP Constellation *-auto-increment depending on number of nodes Clone repository git clone https://github.com/XinFinorg/XDC01-docker-Nnodes.git Step: 1 Install docker & docker-compose sudo ./install_docker.sh Step: 2 Pull image from Docker Hub sudo docker pull xinfinorg/quorum:v2.1.0 Step: 3 Launch the setup script cd static-nodes sudo ./setup.sh Enter number of nodes, private IP of host machine & unique docker subnet.

These nodes communicate using persistent protocols in order to create and validate transactions. There are three broader categories of functionality one such node may have. These pieces of functionality are provided as services, and one node may run several of them. Notary: Nodes running a notary service witness state spends and have the final say in whether a transaction is a double-spend or not Oracle: Network services that link the ledger to the outside world by providing facts that affect the validity of transactions Regular node: All nodes have a vault and may start protocols communicating with other nodes, notaries and oracles and evolve their private ledger Setting up your own network Certificates Every node in a given Corda network must have an identity certificate signed by the network\u2019s root CA. See Network permissioning for more information. Configuration A node can be configured by adding/editing node.conf in the node\u2019s directory. For details see Node configuration. An example configuration: myLegalName : \"O=Bank A,L=London,C=GB\" keyStorePassword : \"cordacadevpass\" trustStorePassword : \"trustpass\" dataSourceProperties : { dataSourceClassName : org.h2.jdbcx.JdbcDataSource \"dataSource.url\" : \"jdbc:h2:file:\"${baseDirectory}\"/persistence\" \"dataSource.user\" : sa \"dataSource.password\" : \"\"} p2pAddress : \"my-corda-node:10002\" rpcSettings = { useSsl = false standAloneBroker = false address : \"my-corda-node:10003\" adminAddress : \"my-corda-node:10004\" } webAddress : \"localhost:10004\" rpcUsers : [ { username=user1, password=letmein, permissions=[ StartFlow.net.corda.protocols.CashProtocol ] } ] devMode : true // certificateSigningService : \"https://testnet.certificate.corda.net\" The most important fields regarding network configuration are: p2pAddress: This specifies a host and port to which Artemis will bind for messaging with other nodes. Note that the address bound will NOT be my-corda-node, but rather :: (all addresses on all network interfaces). The hostname specified is the hostname that must be externally resolvable by other nodes in the network . In the above configuration this is the resolvable name of a machine in a VPN. rpcAddress: The address to which Artemis will bind for RPC calls. webAddress: The address the webserver should bind.

Each block contains a cryptographic hash of the previous block, a timestamp, and transaction data. By design, a blockchain is resistant to modification of the data. One of the best things about the blockchain is since it is a decentralized system that exists between all permitted parties, there is no need to pay intermediaries (Middlemen) and it saves you time and conflicts. Blockchains have their problems, but they are rated, undeniably, faster, cheaper, and more secure than traditional systems, which is why banks and governments are turning to them. Imagine if there were some self-executing contracts, in which contracts would be converted to computer code, stored and replicated on the system and supervised by the network of computers that run the blockchain. All of this is what makes up smart contracts. What are Smart Contracts?: \u00b6 A smart contract is a computer code running on top of a blockchain containing a set of rules under which the parties to that smart contract agree to interact with each other. If and when the predefined rules are met, the agreement is automatically enforced. The smart contract code facilitates, verifies, and enforces the negotiation or performance of an agreement or transaction. It is the simplest form of decentralized automation. In simpler words, it is rather a form of exchange of any type like money, property etc in a conflict-free way without the services of a middleman so it is trustless execution which is an important feature that smart contracts promises. Bitcoin was the first to support basic smart contracts in the sense that the network can transfer value from one person to another. The network of nodes will only validate transactions if certain conditions are met. Here is an example of a simple smart contract where we use simple set and get function then we increment and decrement some data. Features of Smart Contract \u00b6 Various features provided by smart contracts are: 1.Trust \u2014 Your documents are encrypted on a shared ledger. There\u2019s no way that someone can say they lost it. Smart contracts allow parties to commit and bind by the conditions and rules written inside it. 2.Transparency: Everything is written inside a smart contract with intricate details so anyone can read the details before agreeing and thus eliminates the chance of future disputes. There is no miscommunication as all the information is open with everybody. 3. Autonomous: You\u2019re the one making the agreement; there\u2019s no need to rely on a broker, lawyer or other intermediaries to confirm. This also knocks out the danger of manipulation by a third party, since execution is managed automatically by the network. 4.Accuracy: Automated contracts are not only faster and cheaper but also avoid the errors that come from a person making the contract who can miss some conditions but in smart contracts, it will result in an error, therefore, all the conditions are put in a detailed form. 5.Speed: If anyone would read documents or contracts manually it would take a chunk of time, whereas smart contracts are a bunch of code used to automate task and hence save hours of time. 6.Savings: Smart contracts can help to save a lot of money as it removes the presence of an intermediary. For instance, you would pay a lawyer for your case but in smart contracts, it\u2019s all in your hand as the code is the law. 7.Safety: Cryptographically encryption keeps your data safe. Since they match the highest safety standards, the level of protection involved in them allows to be secure to use for critical processes Problem Solution \u00b6 1.We can solve some of the problems with smart contracts like upgrade problems by using modular smart contracts. So, we can have modular.sol files while building on Ethereum that can be easily upgraded without losing information. 2.Using Delegatecall-based proxies for contract upgrading. In delegatecall logic data are kept in separate contracts, but the data contract (the proxy) calls the logic contract through delegatecall. It is difficult to apply the delegatecall-based proxy pattern correctly. The proxy pattern requires that memory layouts stay consistent between contract and compiler upgrades. A developer unfamiliar with EVM internals can easily introduce critical bugs during an upgrade. 3.The legal issues of smart contracts can only be solved over time as they are in their initial development stage; it will require time. 4.The major problem of writing smart contracts can be solved by not implementing Turing-complete smart contracts. 5.And, the oracle problem can be solved maybe by a consensus protocol in the community itself which will help to see how things are in the physical world. Application of Smart Contracts \u00b6 1.Digital Identity: Smart contracts allow users to own and control their digital identity i.ie data, reputation and assets. It provides enterprises with the opportunity to seamlessly know their customers while individuals may not disclose sensitive data which reduces the frictionless know-your-customer requirements. 2.Financial Data Recording: Financial organizations can utilize smart contracts for accurate, transparent financial data recording. Smart contracts allow for uniform financial data across organizations, improving financial reporting and reducing auditing costs.By improving data integrity, smart contracts support increased market stability. They also reduce accounting costs by allowing cost sharing among organizations. 3.Healthcare: Personal health records could be encoded and stored on the blockchain with a private key which would grant access only to specific individuals. The same strategy could be used to ensure that research is conducted via HIPAA laws (in a secure and confidential way). Receipts of surgeries could be stored on a blockchain and automatically sent to insurance providers as proof-of-delivery. The ledger, too, could be used for general healthcare management, such as supervising drugs, regulation compliance, testing results, and managing healthcare supplies. 4.Real Estate: You can get more money through smart contracts. Ordinarily, if you wanted to rent your apartment to someone, you\u2019d need to pay a middleman such as Craigslist or a newspaper to advertise and then again you\u2019d need to pay someone to confirm that the person paid rent and followed through. The ledger cuts your costs. All you do is pay via bitcoin and encode your contract on the ledger. Conclusion \u00b6 Smart contracts do offer a lot and have shown signs of how promising they can be, but they are still in their initial stages so with time maybe we will see their actual potential which could provide for all sorts of social changes which is really exciting. A big problem lies with the organizations as well, as they are adopting blockchains due to the buzzword but not considering how to use it to its fullest. If organizations manage that beforehand then maybe writing smart contracts can get easier. But the actual problem still lies in writing smart contracts and gaining the trust of people again after the DAO hack. In the coming future, we may witness a hybrid of paper and digital content where contracts are verified via blockchain and substantiated by physical copy.","title":"Smart Contract"},{"location":"get-started/smartcont/#what-are-smart-contracts","text":"A smart contract is a computer code running on top of a blockchain containing a set of rules under which the parties to that smart contract agree to interact with each other.

The core of the innovation is built around the concept of a distributed cryptographic database. The database, also referred to as the ledger, is maintained by a network of computers. The ledger makes it possible for the entire network to create, evolve and keep track of an immutable record of transactions. The most successful blockchain application thus far has been Satoshi Nakamoto\u2019 s cryptocurrency known as Bitcoin, which he outlined in his seminal paper, \u201cBitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System\u201d in 2008. This powerful technology has so far been implicated in the numerous cryptocurrencies that exist online. Financial institutions are only beginning to understand the potential applications of blockchain in conventionally regulated industries. Understanding the Blockchain : At a fundamental level the blockchain is a data structure that cryptographically links blocks of transactions or any potential transfers of value. As a paradigm, the blockchain allows for true privacy to exist between those involved in a transaction. This characteristic of the blockchain that makes its most significant implementation in the financial industry. Its structure allows for automation, immutability, and decentralization. These characteristics were carefully chosen by Nakamoto in order to create a digital mechanism of trust. For the financial world this would result in a more limited reliance on third party trust mechanisms enabling a direct contractual interface between two parties involved in any transfer of value. This technology has the power make such exchanges safer, faster, and costeffective. Ownership of value stored in the blockchain is established through asymmetrical cryptography. Digital keys, wallet addresses, and digital signatures are all created cryptographically to ensure total privacy in transmission of transactional data. Every transaction on the blockchain needs to be 'signed' using digital keys. Whoever owns these keys, owns access to the value stored in the wallet. All keys generated by the wallet software come in pairs; a private key, which is kept secret and a public key. The public key is akin to a bank account number and the private key is like the secret pin used to control the account. The idea behind digital signatures is that private and public key pair shares a mathematical relationship such that a message (transaction) signed by a private key can be verified by a public key without revealing the private key. Public Blockchain : The Bitcoin's blockchain network is structured as a peer-to-peer network architecture. In this network implementation, all nodes are equal or symmetric. There is no server, no centralized service, and no hierarchy in the Bitcoin's network. Blockchain implementations for the financial industry however, cannot allow for such an open and symmetric network structure. Bitcoin enthusiasts advocate, therefore, that the blockchain and Bitcoin are fundamentally linked. This is a short sighted view taking into consideration that the Bitcoin technology stack exists to solve the problem of an unregulated digital currency.

The core of the innovation is built around the concept of a distributed cryptographic database. The database, also referred to as the ledger, is maintained by a network of computers. The ledger makes it possible for the entire network to create, evolve and keep track of an immutable record of transactions. The most successful blockchain application thus far has been Satoshi Nakamoto\u2019 s cryptocurrency known as Bitcoin, which he outlined in his seminal paper, \u201cBitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System\u201d in 2008. This powerful technology has so far been implicated in the numerous cryptocurrencies that exist online. Financial institutions are only beginning to understand the potential applications of blockchain in conventionally regulated industries. Understanding the Blockchain : At a fundamental level the blockchain is a data structure that cryptographically links blocks of transactions or any potential transfers of value. As a paradigm, the blockchain allows for true privacy to exist between those involved in a transaction. This characteristic of the blockchain that makes its most significant implementation in the financial industry. Its structure allows for automation, immutability, and decentralization. These characteristics were carefully chosen by Nakamoto in order to create a digital mechanism of trust. For the financial world this would result in a more limited reliance on third party trust mechanisms enabling a direct contractual interface between two parties involved in any transfer of value. This technology has the power make such exchanges safer, faster, and costeffective. Ownership of value stored in the blockchain is established through asymmetrical cryptography. Digital keys, wallet addresses, and digital signatures are all created cryptographically to ensure total privacy in transmission of transactional data. Every transaction on the blockchain needs to be 'signed' using digital keys. Whoever owns these keys, owns access to the value stored in the wallet. All keys generated by the wallet software come in pairs; a private key, which is kept secret and a public key. The public key is akin to a bank account number and the private key is like the secret pin used to control the account. The idea behind digital signatures is that private and public key pair shares a mathematical relationship such that a message (transaction) signed by a private key can be verified by a public key without revealing the private key. Public Blockchain : The Bitcoin's blockchain network is structured as a peer-to-peer network architecture. In this network implementation, all nodes are equal or symmetric. There is no server, no centralized service, and no hierarchy in the Bitcoin's network. Blockchain implementations for the financial industry however, cannot allow for such an open and symmetric network structure. Bitcoin enthusiasts advocate, therefore, that the blockchain and Bitcoin are fundamentally linked. This is a short sighted view taking into consideration that the Bitcoin technology stack exists to solve the problem of an unregulated digital currency. The same stack can be evolved to solve similar transfers of value over an asymmetric network. The XDC Protocol: Technical Whitepaper by Xinfin Organization. September 2017. All rights reserved.
