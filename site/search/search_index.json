The objective of XinFin Network is to become a leading part of this phenomenon through seamlessly merging an ecosystem of applications with cryptographic tokens used by millions of mainstream users with a unique blockchain infrastructure architecture, allowing for fast, frictionless payment and a secure, decentralised, and trusted store of value. XinFin Network aims to be a public EVM-compatible blockchain with the following advantages: low transaction fee, fast confirmation time, double validation and randomization for security guarantees. XinFin Network envisions an ecosystem of different DApps running on the XinFin Network blockchain infrastructure. In particular, we propose a solution for solving the transaction processing performance bottleneck in Ethereum which hinders its adoption into industries, especially finance. More specifically, we are constructing an efficient and secured consensus protocol, which tackles the following main bottlenecks of classic blockchains: Efficiency: The small throughput of Bitcoin and Ethereum severely hinders a widespread adoption of such crypto- currencies. Confirmation times: Bitcoin takes on average 1 hour to confirm a transaction because the confirmation of a Bitcoin block requires 5 subsequent blocks created following it. While Ethereum uses a smaller block-time, the average confirmation time still remains relatively high, around 13 minutes. These long confirmation times hinder many important applications (especially smart contract applications). Fork Generation: The problem of fork chain consumes computational energy, time, and creates potential vulnerabilities for different types of attacks. In the newly published technical paper, XinFin Network proposes the XinFin Delegated Proof-of-Stake (XDPoS) consensus, which is a PoS-based blockchain protocol. The consensus has the following key novelties: Double Validation to strengthen security and reduce fork Randomization to guarantee the fair and prevent handshaking attack Fast confirmation time and efficient checkpoints for finality or rebase","title":"Introduction"},{"location":"Community/support/","text":"Welcome, The communities and posts below include content that has been curated by XinFin team members, community members and projects building on XinFin Platform.

XinFin Network is an innovative solution to the scalability problem of the Ethereum blockchain, and other current blockchain platforms. XinFin Network relies on a system of 18 Masternodes with XinFin Delegated Proof of stake (XDPOS)consensus that can support low transaction fees and 2-second transaction confirmation times. Security, stability and chain finality are guaranteed via novel techniques such as double validation, staking via smart-contracts and true randomization processes. XinFin Network supports all EVM-compatible smart-contracts, protocols, and atomic cross-chain token transfers. New scaling techniques such as sharding, EVM parallelisation, private-chain generation, hardware integration will be continuously researched and incorporated into XinFin Network's Masternode architecture. It will be an ideal scalable smart-contract public blockchain for decentralized apps, token issuances and token integrations for small and big businesses. What problem is XinFin Network aiming to solve? The problems that XinFin Network aims to solve can be summarized as follows: The network congestion on Ethereum (low transaction time) High transaction fees on Ethereum Most other blockchains are highly centralized and/or do not have interoperability with Ethereum system Blockchain has become one of the most disruptive technologies that enables many decentralized applications, including but not limited to cryptocurrencies, smart-contracts and supply-chain management. Blockchain proponents have been trying to inject it into this Industry 4.0 revolution era. In order to reach this goal, the current blockchain infrastructure must at least be able to compete with many mainstream technologies, such as Visa and MasterCard processors in financial services. Nevertheless, the reality is disappointing: Bitcoin and Ethereum can only process around 7 and 15 transactions per second, respectively. Remember that, these numbers in Visa and MasterCard are around 5'000-6'000 transactions per second. XinFin Network is continuously working and researching several scaling solutions. Regarding on-chain scaling, Sharding and Proof-of-Stake-based consensus are of potential that can significantly improve transaction processing performance while trying to maintain security requirements of the system. How does XinFin Network work? What is the architecture and consensus used? XinFin Network relies on a system of 18 Masternodes with XinFin Delegated Proof of stake (XDPoS) consensus that can support low fees (approx. 1/100 of that of Ethereum's) and 2-second transaction confirmation times. Security, stability and chain finality are guaranteed via novel techniques such as Double Validation. Can you tell more about XinFin Delegated Proof of stake (XDPoS)? What is it? At the heart of XinFin Network, the XinFin Delegated Proof of stake (XDPoS) consensus enables XinFin Network as an EVM-compatible and scalable public blockchain, on which every Ethereum smart contract can be effectively run with almost instant transaction confirmation. XDPoS features its Masternode architecture in which token holders deposit 10,000,000 XDC to become a masternode. masternode are selected for block creation within a period, called epoch. Each masternode takes its block creation in a round-robin manner every 2-second and follows the double validation technique for security reinforcement. A block is finalised if it is signed off by 3/4 masternodes. At the end of each epoch, the masternodes that have signed finalised blocks are rewarded. What is Double Validation? Double Validation provides an additional trustless validation layer for security enhancement through a provable uniform distribution decentralized randomization. Specifically, when a block is created by a masternode, it must be verified by another masternode that is randomly selected among the set of masternodes before being added to the blockchain. Double validation strengthens XinFin Blockchain security, reduces fork and makes XinFin Network unique among other Delegated Proof of stake based blockchains. What is an 'epoch'? An epoch is a 900-block period of 2-second block time starting from block #1 (900 blocks x 2s/block = around 1800s or ~30 minutes). Which scaling solutions will XinFin Network implement? Will you have sharding? XinFin Network solutions are based on on-chain scaling built into an architecture of 18 masternodes with our XinFin Delegated Proof of stake (XDPoS) consensus protocol. We achieve 2-second block-time and almost instant transaction confirmation. To scale further our infrastructure, we have presented our Sharding proposal for uniquely integrating Sharding into our current architecture and consensus. Besides sharding, we are actively researching scalability solutions like EVM parallelization and Plasma. New scaling techniques such as sharding, EVM parallelisation, private-chain generation, hardware integration will be evaluated before being integrated into XinFin Network's masternode architecture. What makes XinFin Network different? The unique point of XinFin Network comes from technology, the products and the ecosystem. Novel technology: includes XinFin Delegated Proof of stake (XDPoS) consensus Build in governance D-app Double Validation and Randomization Sharding based on a stable masternode artichitecture This enables XinFin Network to achieve: Cheap transactions: approx. 1/100 of that of Ethereum 2000 TPS to handle a robust d-app and token ecosystem. 2 second block time for fast transactions EVM-compatibility allows for interoperability with Ethereum ecosystem. Our unique products XinFinScan: Shows all blocks, transactions, finality, smart contracts, D-Apps and token information XinFinMaster: Allows users to apply for a Masternode Candidate position; and shows Masternode performance statistics xdcwallet: Securely store, send, receive XinFin and other tokens issued on XinFin Network; Allows users to track rewards Our own ecosystem XinFin Network also is working vigorously on building its ecosystem and has sealed many partnerships from all fields such as agriculture, robotics, gaming, IT solution providers, advertising, pharmaceutical tracking, education and research, payment, communication, name service, food traceability and tourism. Which blockchain(s) are XinFin Network's main competitors? On the one hand, all base layer blockchains such as Ethereum, EOS, NEM, NEO etc are competitors because app developers/token issuers will generally choose only one blockchain to work on. On the other hand, it is too early to focus on competition as it is more important to expand the whole blockchain ecosystem rather than to compete. XinFin Network has a unique position in which it adds value to the Ethereum ecosystem by addressing scalability and governance issues while keeping the same smart-contracts and general architecture. XinFin Network is EVM-compatible. What does that mean? EVM means Ethereum Virtual Machine. XinFin Network supports all EVM-compatible smart-contracts, protocols, and atomic cross-chain token transfers. This means that any smart-contract written in Ethereum protocol can be easily ported to XinFin Network. Any d-App written in Ethereum can be seamlessly ported to XinFin Network. Is XinFin Network a side-chain of Ethereum? XinFin Network has its own blockchain since XinFin Network Mainnet is about to launch. Is XinFin Network compatible with Ethereum? Yes, any smart-contract written in Ethereum protocol can be easily ported to XinFin Network. This is one strength appealing to some dApp developers and some of our partners. Can developers make hybrid dApps using both Ethereum and XinFin Network in one single dApp? Yes, they can make an app, and deploy it to both Ethereum, and XinFin Network. It can be done relatively easy since XinFin Network supports EVM, and share a common architecture with Ethereum. How do you solve 'security problems' when using XinFin Network? In terms of security of consensus protocol, XinFin Network proposes Double Validation and Randomization to protect the system. XinFin Network solves some consensus-related security aspects: This problem is commonly discussed in PoS-based blockchain consensus and just like 51% attacks in PoW. XinFin Network solves it by using Double Validation and Randomization. The details are shown in our technical paper. Long-range attacks: Attackers can try to recreate all blocks from a very far position to the current block. Attackers can do that because PoS-based consensus does not require extra-ordinary hashing power to re-write the whole blockchain. XinFin Network addresses by providing finality. Once a block is signed by at least 3/4 masternodes, it is consider irreversible, meaning that any attempt to re-write the blockchain history will be rejected. DDoS and spamming attacks: XinFin Network's transaction fee is not zero (even it is very low), attackers still require a significant amount of XDC in order to flood the network for only a short time.

Can you describe the functions and purposes of XinFin? XDC is the native cryptocurrency of XinFin Network and will be the reserve cryptocurrency for all third-party apps running on XinFin Network. Being the protocol token for the XinFin Network infrastructure, XDC will be needed by all parties utilising XinFin Network to build apps or issue and integrate cryptographic tokens into their apps. The supply of XDC is fixed, long-term and non-inflationary. In addition to the above, XDC is an integral part of the XinFin Network network for a number of reasons. XinFin will be used to fund the development of XinFin Network and its ecosystem (XinFinScan, XinFinMaster, XinFinWebWallet, etc.). XinFin will be used as a incentivise the building of the XinFin Network engine/ecosystem. XinFin will be used as a long-term, decentralized governance instrument of the XinFin Network network. You can check our technical whitepaper for more details. Can I mine XDC? XDC is not mineable but mintable by masternodes. Masternodes are responsible for creating, verifying and finalizing the blocks created within a period, called epoch. Masternodes will receive block rewards. How often are block rewards paid out? Block rewards will be earnt every epoch, which lasts for 900 of two-second-block time (~30 minutes) When will XDC be listed on new exchanges? We do not discuss about exchange related questions due to the regulation. We will announce every exchange news on our official channels on due time. Is XDC an ERC-20 token? Since Mainnet is above to Launch, XDC has become the native coin of the XinFin Network blockchain. Where to store XDC? How can I send XDC to my wallet? You can store XinFin in XinFin Web Wallet or Mobile Wallet. Where can I buy XDC? (exchanges) For Now You can trade XDC on alphaex . Masternodes \u00b6 Does XinFin Network have Masternodes? How do they work? Yes, XinFin Network has a maximum of 18 Masternodes with XinFin Delegated Proof of stake (XDPOS) consensus for low transaction fee, and instant transaction confirmation. Masternodes create, verify and validate new blocks in XinFin platform. Masternode Candidates: Any account can deposit 10,000,000 XDC using XinFinMaster to become a masternode candidate. A candidate can resign, but the tokens will be locked for the next 30 days (1,296,000 blocks) after the resignation. A Masternode can resign, but the tokens will be locked for the next 30 days after the resignation. Rewards: The rewards a masternode receives in each epoch is proportional to the number of signatures it signs. Masternodes will also receive fees from the XinFin Network which is planned for development. XinFin Network masternodes started signing blocks and receiving block rewards on Mainnet. What is a masternode in the XinFin Network ecosystem? A XinFin Network masternode is a server which uses its computing power to contribute to the network. Its job is to create and sign blocks. For this contribution to the network, masternodes receive rewards in the form of XDC. What are the incentives to run a masternode? Masternodes contribute to the network and for this work they will receive a significant amount of block rewards, which will likely exceed the cost for running the infrastructure. However, masternode owners need to invest in XinFin Network by depositing at least 10,000,000 XDC, for the long term. When are Masternode rewards paid out? Masternode operators will receive rewards every epoch. An epoch is a 900-block period of 2-second block time (~30 minutes). How can I check my rewards? You can check your masternode rewards using XinFin WebWallet. Alternatively you can use XinFinScan. Masternode Candidate \u00b6 What is a masternode candidate? What is the difference between masternode candidate and masternode? A Masternode Candidate is any node who deposited 10,000,000 XDC and is listed on XinFinMaster . masternodes will be able to sign blocks and receive block rewards. How can I become a Masternode? The first step to become a masternode, is becoming a masternode candidate. To become a Masternode Candidate you need: to run XinFin Network software in a machine with certain minimal hardware requirements to deposit 10,000,000 XDC in a smart-contract via XinFinMaster The list of Masternode Candidates will be available on the governance DApp, XinFinMaster . Do I need to use my own computer to run a node? We recommend using an IaaS (\"cloud\") provider of your choice (like Amazon AWS, Digital Ocean, Google Cloud GCE, Vultr, etc). The machine must be directly facing internet (public IP, no NAT) and with 100% uptime. Which are the hardware requirements to run a node? Processing transactions is mostly CPU bound. Therefore we recommend running CPU optimized servers. Directly facing internet (public IP, no NAT) 16 cores CPU 32GB of RAM SSD storage We recommend using popular cloud providers as their reliability and uptime are close to 100%. Those servers would be a good starting point: DigitalOcean: CPU optimized droplet 32GB/16CPU Amazon EC2: C5 instance Google Cloud Engine: n1-highcpu-16 Setting up a masternode candidate on a weaker machine might result in poor performances, significantly impacting owner's rewards and the chain performance. Note: If you are running a node in Testnet, 2CPU/8GB of RAM is sufficient. How do Masternode Candidates become Masternodes? Once you are a Masternode Candidate, you need the support of XinFin Network community. Masternode candidates every period called epoch (900 blocks of 2-second block-time) will be promoted to Masternode. This list will change dynamically every epoch. masternodes will be able to sign blocks and will receive rewards in the form of XDC. Do I need two wallets to run a Masternode? It is recommended for security reasons. You can create your wallet from wherever you want, the only rule being that you need two of them. One for your masternode, and one to make the 10,000,000 XDC deposit (this account will receive the rewards). What is the 'coinbase address'? 'Coinbase address' is the public address used to run your node and register it to the system. We recommend using two addresses when running your nodes. The public address or 'coinbase address' will only receive transaction fees. The private address is from where you make the initial 10,000,000 XDC deposit and where the block rewards will be collected. How can I create a public 'coinbase address' wallet? Is it only with xdcwallet for Android? Are there other options? You need to create a wallet for the masternode public address. This wallet does not need to contain any XDC, think of it as a shell address. You will then stake XDC into the masternode address via your main XinFin Web wallet. You can use the Android apps. Also you can create wallets with XinFin Web Wallet. You can also use https://wallet.testnet.xinfin.org to create an empty wallet, then use it as coinbase address. I noticed that we need another wallet for masternode? It is recommended to use a separate empty account for your masternode as it only receive transactions fees - what we call public or 'coinbase address' on the documentation. The block rewards are sent to the account connected to XinFinMaster who make the initial deposit - the 'private' address. Can I use the same address pair (XinFin-Node or One-Click-Installer public address + initial deposit address) for all my nodes? Or I have to transfer tokens to another wallet and start the second node? No. Must use different public 'coinbase' addresses. But you can use the same initial deposit ('private') address, then all rewards will be transferred to only one address. I have finished all steps of setting up node. Why I don't see my node on XinFinMaster? You must apply to become a masternode candidate. Do I need to deposit the 10,000,000 XDC before or after running 'One-Click-Installer' in VPS? After. Your node must be fully synched before applying. How do I check the blockchain sync status from the node? You can watch the logs, but it is easier from the XinFinStats website or its eth.blockNumber API call. If the masternode owner deposits 11,000,000 XDC instead of 10,000,000 XDC on its own node, can it later on unstake the excess ? Yes, it can. Why is a node flagged as 'Slashed'? A masternode will be automatically slashed by the Slashing Mechanism if the node doesn't validate any block within an epoch. Some reasons for this might be that the masternode does not have the correct XinFin Network software, lack of memory or masternode crashes due to the lack of e-maintenance and operation by the masternode owner. A Slashed node will be 'kicked out' for the next 4 epochs. At the 5th epoch after being slashed, the slashed masternode can go back to the candidate list. How many nodes I am allowed to run? As many as you can. How can I resign as Masternode? If you no longer want to be a masternode, you can resign on XinFinMaster. Your masternode will stop generating rewards and your funds will be locked for 30 days (1 296 000 blocks). After the lockup period you will be able to withdraw your 10,000,000 XDC deposit. Can I close the node entirely, then start a new one with a totally separate coinbase address without being penalized? No. Your old node will be penalized (10,000,000 XDC initial deposit 30-day lockup) and your new node has to apply again. Is it possible to move a masternode later, like backup and start it from another IP address? Yes. Products \u00b6 XinFinScan \u00b6 What is XinFinScan? XinFinScan is our block explorer. It is pretty similar to EtherScan if you are already familiar with it. XinFinScan provides a user friendly, details and perfection-oriented user interface for XinFin Network block explorer. From a user perspective, XinFinScan brings XinFinChain\u2019s transparency to users, because all block, transaction, finality, smart contracts, dApp and token information are read from XinFin Network and shown to users. Furthermore, XinFinScan also offers technical visualisations and does useful statistics about the XinFin Network performance, token holders and other functionalities. What is a TxHash? How to check a TxHash? TxHash stands for 'transaction hash', and is also known as a transaction ID. An example of what a TxHash looks like: 0x838d33119b33e4519cb201e49bfc570ddc0fbdc6d9cf7038d8254a4de97f7112 To check a TxHash, follow the steps below: On XinFinScan , go to the search bar with the magnifying glass icon. Paste your transaction hash (TxHash) in the search bar and click the icon or press ENTER. Your transaction details will show up. XinFinStats \u00b6 What is XinFinStats? XinFinStats shows the various metrics regarding the current mainnet including the current number of masternodes, masternodes performance, current TPS, block-time, confirmation time, finality and other useful metrics. How much is the average time to see my node appear on XinFinStats? It should be less than a minute after One-Click-Installer command is executed and finished. Stats page wasn't working and showed a 70-second block. What happened? The stats page is javascript code running in your browser. If your computer loses internet connection or the page is not active anymore for some reasons, the time will increase forever. In this case just refresh the page. XinFinMaster \u00b6 What is XinFinMaster? XinFinMaster , the 'Governance dApp', provides a professional UI that allows to see the list of masternodes and candidates, to deposit 10,000,000 XDC to become a masternode candidate, to vote for masternodes, and to show masternode performance statistics. How do I login on XinFinMaster? Go to XinFinMaster. On the top-right corner click 'Login'. Then select how do you want to login: with Private Key. What is the 'capacity' of a Candidate/Masternode? The capacity of a candidate is the 10,000,000 XDC initial deposit for that candidate. What is a 'checkpoint'? For each iteration of 900 blocks (called epoch), a checkpoint block is created, which implements only reward works. The masternode, who takes turn in the circular and sequential order to create blocks, has to scan all of the created blocks in the epoch and count number of signatures. It is worth noting that token holders who unvote before the checkpoint block will not receive any shared reward in the Staking Reward portion. I want to stop running my node. If you don't want to run your masternode anymore, please remember to resign before shutting down the node.","title":"FAQ"},{"location":"general/faq/#general","text":"","title":"General"},{"location":"general/faq/#xinfin-network","text":"What is XinFin Network? XinFin Network is an innovative solution to the scalability problem of the Ethereum blockchain, and other current blockchain platforms. XinFin Network relies on a system of 18 Masternodes with XinFin Delegated Proof of stake (XDPOS)consensus that can support low transaction fees and 2-second transaction confirmation times. Security, stability and chain finality are guaranteed via novel techniques such as double validation, staking via smart-contracts and true randomization processes. XinFin Network supports all EVM-compatible smart-contracts, protocols, and atomic cross-chain token transfers. New scaling techniques such as sharding, EVM parallelisation, private-chain generation, hardware integration will be continuously researched and incorporated into XinFin Network's Masternode architecture. It will be an ideal scalable smart-contract public blockchain for decentralized apps, token issuances and token integrations for small and big businesses. What problem is XinFin Network aiming to solve? The problems that XinFin Network aims to solve can be summarized as follows: The network congestion on Ethereum (low transaction time) High transaction fees on Ethereum Most other blockchains are highly centralized and/or do not have interoperability with Ethereum system Blockchain has become one of the most disruptive technologies that enables many decentralized applications, including but not limited to cryptocurrencies, smart-contracts and supply-chain management. Blockchain proponents have been trying to inject it into this Industry 4.0 revolution era. In order to reach this goal, the current blockchain infrastructure must at least be able to compete with many mainstream technologies, such as Visa and MasterCard processors in financial services. Nevertheless, the reality is disappointing: Bitcoin and Ethereum can only process around 7 and 15 transactions per second, respectively. Remember that, these numbers in Visa and MasterCard are around 5'000-6'000 transactions per second. XinFin Network is continuously working and researching several scaling solutions. Regarding on-chain scaling, Sharding and Proof-of-Stake-based consensus are of potential that can significantly improve transaction processing performance while trying to maintain security requirements of the system. How does XinFin Network work? What is the architecture and consensus used? XinFin Network relies on a system of 18 Masternodes with XinFin Delegated Proof of stake (XDPoS) consensus that can support low fees (approx. 1/100 of that of Ethereum's) and 2-second transaction confirmation times. Security, stability and chain finality are guaranteed via novel techniques such as Double Validation. Can you tell more about XinFin Delegated Proof of stake (XDPoS)? What is it? At the heart of XinFin Network, the XinFin Delegated Proof of stake (XDPoS) consensus enables XinFin Network as an EVM-compatible and scalable public blockchain, on which every Ethereum smart contract can be effectively run with almost instant transaction confirmation. XDPoS features its Masternode architecture in which token holders deposit 10,000,000 XDC to become a masternode. masternode are selected for block creation within a period, called epoch. Each masternode takes its block creation in a round-robin manner every 2-second and follows the double validation technique for security reinforcement. A block is finalised if it is signed off by 3/4 masternodes. At the end of each epoch, the masternodes that have signed finalised blocks are rewarded. What is Double Validation? Double Validation provides an additional trustless validation layer for security enhancement through a provable uniform distribution decentralized randomization. Specifically, when a block is created by a masternode, it must be verified by another masternode that is randomly selected among the set of masternodes before being added to the blockchain. Double validation strengthens XinFin Blockchain security, reduces fork and makes XinFin Network unique among other Delegated Proof of stake based blockchains. What is an 'epoch'? An epoch is a 900-block period of 2-second block time starting from block #1 (900 blocks x 2s/block = around 1800s or ~30 minutes). Which scaling solutions will XinFin Network implement? Will you have sharding? XinFin Network solutions are based on on-chain scaling built into an architecture of 18 masternodes with our XinFin Delegated Proof of stake (XDPoS) consensus protocol. We achieve 2-second block-time and almost instant transaction confirmation. To scale further our infrastructure, we have presented our Sharding proposal for uniquely integrating Sharding into our current architecture and consensus. Besides sharding, we are actively researching scalability solutions like EVM parallelization and Plasma. New scaling techniques such as sharding, EVM parallelisation, private-chain generation, hardware integration will be evaluated before being integrated into XinFin Network's masternode architecture. What makes XinFin Network different? The unique point of XinFin Network comes from technology, the products and the ecosystem. Novel technology: includes XinFin Delegated Proof of stake (XDPoS) consensus Build in governance D-app Double Validation and Randomization Sharding based on a stable masternode artichitecture This enables XinFin Network to achieve: Cheap transactions: approx. 1/100 of that of Ethereum 2000 TPS to handle a robust d-app and token ecosystem. 2 second block time for fast transactions EVM-compatibility allows for interoperability with Ethereum ecosystem. Our unique products XinFinScan: Shows all blocks, transactions, finality, smart contracts, D-Apps and token information XinFinMaster: Allows users to apply for a Masternode Candidate position; and shows Masternode performance statistics xdcwallet: Securely store, send, receive XinFin and other tokens issued on XinFin Network; Allows users to track rewards Our own ecosystem XinFin Network also is working vigorously on building its ecosystem and has sealed many partnerships from all fields such as agriculture, robotics, gaming, IT solution providers, advertising, pharmaceutical tracking, education and research, payment, communication, name service, food traceability and tourism. Which blockchain(s) are XinFin Network's main competitors? On the one hand, all base layer blockchains such as Ethereum, EOS, NEM, NEO etc are competitors because app developers/token issuers will generally choose only one blockchain to work on. On the other hand, it is too early to focus on competition as it is more important to expand the whole blockchain ecosystem rather than to compete. XinFin Network has a unique position in which it adds value to the Ethereum ecosystem by addressing scalability and governance issues while keeping the same smart-contracts and general architecture. XinFin Network is EVM-compatible. What does that mean? EVM means Ethereum Virtual Machine. XinFin Network supports all EVM-compatible smart-contracts, protocols, and atomic cross-chain token transfers. This means that any smart-contract written in Ethereum protocol can be easily ported to XinFin Network. Any d-App written in Ethereum can be seamlessly ported to XinFin Network. Is XinFin Network a side-chain of Ethereum? XinFin Network has its own blockchain since XinFin Network Mainnet is about to launch. Is XinFin Network compatible with Ethereum? Yes, any smart-contract written in Ethereum protocol can be easily ported to XinFin Network. This is one strength appealing to some dApp developers and some of our partners. Can developers make hybrid dApps using both Ethereum and XinFin Network in one single dApp? Yes, they can make an app, and deploy it to both Ethereum, and XinFin Network. It can be done relatively easy since XinFin Network supports EVM, and share a common architecture with Ethereum. How do you solve 'security problems' when using XinFin Network? In terms of security of consensus protocol, XinFin Network proposes Double Validation and Randomization to protect the system. XinFin Network solves some consensus-related security aspects: This problem is commonly discussed in PoS-based blockchain consensus and just like 51% attacks in PoW. XinFin Network solves it by using Double Validation and Randomization. The details are shown in our technical paper. Long-range attacks: Attackers can try to recreate all blocks from a very far position to the current block. Attackers can do that because PoS-based consensus does not require extra-ordinary hashing power to re-write the whole blockchain. XinFin Network addresses by providing finality. Once a block is signed by at least 3/4 masternodes, it is consider irreversible, meaning that any attempt to re-write the blockchain history will be rejected. DDoS and spamming attacks: XinFin Network's transaction fee is not zero (even it is very low), attackers still require a significant amount of XDC in order to flood the network for only a short time.","title":"XinFin Network"},{"location":"general/faq/#company","text":"Where is XinFin Network registered?

For each iteration of 900 blocks (called epoch), a checkpoint block is created, which implements only reward works. The masternode, who takes turn in the circular and sequential order to create blocks, has to scan all of the created blocks in the epoch and count number of signatures. It is worth noting that token holders who unvote before the checkpoint block will not receive any shared reward in the Staking Reward portion. I want to stop running my node.

XinFin's blockchain is a combination of permissioned and public chains that can nicely address security and scalability. XinFin Hybrid Blockchain platform has matured through continuous development and improvements. XinFin's Consensus Mechanism XinFin removed traditional high electrical power consumption based mining mechanism called PoW (Proof of Work). Instead XinFin adopted an improved consensus methodology called PoS (Proof of Stake), and is now slowly moving towards XinFin Delegated Proof of Stake (XDPoS). To understand behind XinFin's decision to go for XDPoS, we need to discuss briefly about the consensus mechanisms. What is Consensus and how PoS, and XDPoS are better than PoW Consensus means a general agreement which is an important component of blockchain technology. Instead of keeping the accounts in a centralized computing machine, as in a bank or centralized online payment system, cryptocurrency uses distributed ledgers or blockchains to record information. A general agreement is needed to record information, such as the balance of every address, transactions, etc. on the blockchain. Proof of Work or PoW relies on solving a cryptographic puzzle repetitively over all the nodes of the network. PoW involves burning very high amount of electrical energy. Proof of Stake doesn't need computers for repetitive solving of the cryptographic puzzle. Insead of miners, PoS requires some validators who will lock some of their crypto coins as stake or deposit. Anybody who holds crypto tokens can become a validator by processing a special type of transaction to lock their crypto fund. A group of validators takes part to propose the next block, and the weight of each validator's depends on the uptime of the node. When the validators discover a block which they think can be added to the blockchain, they will validate it by placing a bet on it. The validators will get a reward proportionate to their bets. How XinFin Delegated Proof of Stake works XinFin Delegated Proof-of-Stake (XDPoS) is more efficient than PoS consensus mechanism. XDPoS uses a reputation system to achieve consensus. The Master node of the network create blocks in a round robin manner. The elected block producers or the witnesses are rewarded for validation of the transactions for the next block. i) Block producers are elected randomly and are limited in numbers who can sign and create blocks. ii) Block validators are the full nodes who verify that the blocks created by the block producers follow the consensus rule. The main difference between XDPoS and PoS is in the consensus mechanism of XDPoS. The community members have more rights in governance of the network. pos and cons of XinFin Delegated Proof of Stake In XDPoS consensus, only the Master Node or the block producers can create the blocks. The transactions are permitted only within the limited number of witnesses. Therefore, XDPoS helps to make processing faster, reduce cost and improve scaling. The witnesses are regularly monitored. If they are found to be malicious, i.e. try to censor transactions or double spend, the other master node can fire a witness by slashing them for the next round. XinFin prefers XDPoS because of speed, cost and scalability Since XDPoS is more democratic, faster, efficient and effective to scale, XinFin naturally preferred to XDPoS.","title":"POW Replaced with DPOS"},{"location":"get-started/Setupmn/","text":"Setup a Masternode with XinFin MainNet in 8 Simple Steps \u00b6 Step 1: Host the Masternode either by downloading the One-Click Installer (recommended) or by using a Docker Compose file.

Definitions XDPoS: XinFin Delegated Proof of Stake: a mechanism for the selection of network Validators by coin holders delegating their Validator: (usually denoted L) a node on the network responsible for producing and validating blocks. Nominator: a coin holder who stakes and delegates their coins to one or more Validators. Epoch: (usually denoted \ud835\udc41) corresponds to \ud835\udc3f\u2208\u2115 blocks: it is a cycle of a few blocks in which Validators create blocks in turn. Validators Registration \u00b6 Any network participant will be able to register as a Validator. A specified value REGISTRATION_VALUE (in the native token) will be sent to a registerfunction on the contract. It will be burnt in order to limit the number of participants. The validator is required to add KYC document at the time of staking XDC token. A hard limit to the total number of registered Validators MAX_REGISTERED_VALIDATORSshould be specified.

Common Terms \u00b6 Nominator: A coin holder who stakes or delegates their coin to one or more validator. Validator: A semi-trusted entity responsible for validating and producing blocks.

The transaction fees can reduce to even 0.01$ per transaction.","title":"Benifits:"},{"location":"get-started/hybnet/","text":"XinFin Private (QuorumFork) \u00b6 Prerequisite Operating System: Ubuntu 16.04 64-bit or higher Tools: Docker, Docker Compose Hardware: CPU : 24 RAM : 08GB HDD : 500GB Network Ports Following network ports need to be open for the nodes to communicate 21001-2100* TCP/UDP GETH 22001-2200* TCP RPC 23001-2300* TCP RAFT 9001-900* TCP Constellation *-auto-increment depending on number of nodes Clone repository git clone https://github.com/XinFinorg/XDC01-docker-Nnodes.git Step: 1 Install docker & docker-compose sudo ./install_docker.sh Step: 2 Pull image from Docker Hub sudo docker pull xinfinorg/quorum:v2.1.0 Step: 3 Launch the setup script cd static-nodes sudo ./setup.sh Enter number of nodes, private IP of host machine & unique docker subnet.

These nodes communicate using persistent protocols in order to create and validate transactions. There are three broader categories of functionality one such node may have. These pieces of functionality are provided as services, and one node may run several of them. Notary: Nodes running a notary service witness state spends and have the final say in whether a transaction is a double-spend or not Oracle: Network services that link the ledger to the outside world by providing facts that affect the validity of transactions Regular node: All nodes have a vault and may start protocols communicating with other nodes, notaries and oracles and evolve their private ledger Setting up your own network Certificates Every node in a given Corda network must have an identity certificate signed by the network\u2019s root CA. See Network permissioning for more information. Configuration A node can be configured by adding/editing node.conf in the node\u2019s directory. For details see Node configuration. An example configuration: myLegalName : \"O=Bank A,L=London,C=GB\" keyStorePassword : \"cordacadevpass\" trustStorePassword : \"trustpass\" dataSourceProperties : { dataSourceClassName : org.h2.jdbcx.JdbcDataSource \"dataSource.url\" : \"jdbc:h2:file:\"${baseDirectory}\"/persistence\" \"dataSource.user\" : sa \"dataSource.password\" : \"\"} p2pAddress : \"my-corda-node:10002\" rpcSettings = { useSsl = false standAloneBroker = false address : \"my-corda-node:10003\" adminAddress : \"my-corda-node:10004\" } webAddress : \"localhost:10004\" rpcUsers : [ { username=user1, password=letmein, permissions=[ StartFlow.net.corda.protocols.CashProtocol ] } ] devMode : true // certificateSigningService : \"https://testnet.certificate.corda.net\" The most important fields regarding network configuration are: p2pAddress: This specifies a host and port to which Artemis will bind for messaging with other nodes. Note that the address bound will NOT be my-corda-node, but rather :: (all addresses on all network interfaces). The hostname specified is the hostname that must be externally resolvable by other nodes in the network . In the above configuration this is the resolvable name of a machine in a VPN. rpcAddress: The address to which Artemis will bind for RPC calls. webAddress: The address the webserver should bind. Note that the port must be distinct from that of p2pAddress and rpcAddress if they are on the same machine. Bootstrapping the network The nodes see each other using the network map. This is a collection of statically signed node-info files, one for each node in the network. Most production deployments will use a highly available, secure distribution of the network map via HTTP. For test deployments where the nodes (at least initially) reside on the same filesystem, these node-info files can be placed directly in the node\u2019s additional-node-infos directory from where the node will pick them up and store them in its local network map cache. The node generates its own node-info file on startup. In addition to the network map, all the nodes on a network must use the same set of network parameters. These are a set of constants which guarantee interoperability between nodes. The HTTP network map distributes the network parameters which the node downloads automatically. In the absence of this the network parameters must be generated locally. This can be done with the network bootstrapper. This is a tool that scans all the node configurations from a common directory to generate the network parameters file which is copied to the nodes\u2019 directories. It also copies each node\u2019s node-info file to every other node so that they can all transact with each other. The bootstrapper tool can be built with the command: gradlew buildBootstrapperJar The resulting jar can be found in tools/bootstrapper/build/libs/ To use it, create a directory containing a node.conf file for each node you want to create. Then run the following command: java -jar network-bootstrapper.jar <nodes-root-dir For example running the command on a directory containing these files : . +-- notary.conf // The notary's node.conf file +-- partya.conf // Party A's node.conf file +-- partyb.conf // Party B's node.conf file Would generate directories containing three nodes: notary, partya and partyb. This tool only bootstraps a network. It cannot dynamically update if a new node needs to join the network or if an existing one has changed something in their node-info, e.g. their P2P address. For this the new node-info file will need to be placed in the other nodes\u2019 additional-node-infos directory. A simple way to do this is to use rsync. However, if it\u2019s known beforehand the set of nodes that will eventually the node folders can be pregenerated in the bootstrap and only started when needed. Whitelisting Contracts If you want to create a Zone whitelist (see API: Contract Constraints), you can pass in a list of CorDapp jars: `java -jar network-bootstrapper.jar The CorDapp jars will be hashed and scanned for Contract classes. By default the tool would generate a file named whitelist.txt containing an entry for each contract with the hash of the jar. For example: net.corda.finance.contracts.asset.Obligation:decd098666b9657314870e192ced0c3519c2c9d395507a238338f8d003929de8 net.corda.finance.contracts.asset.Cash:decd098666b9657314870e192ced0c3519c2c9d395507a238338f8d003929de9 These will be added to the NetworkParameters.whitelistedContractImplementations. See Network Map. This means that by default the Network bootstrapper tool will whitelist all contracts found in all passed CorDapps. In case there is a whitelist.txt file in the root dir already, the tool will append the new jar hashes or contracts to it. The zone operator will maintain this whitelist file, and, using the tool, will append new versions of CorDapps to it. Warning The zone operator must ensure that this file is append only. If the operator removes hashes from the list, all transactions pointing to that version will suddenly fail the constraint verification, and the entire chain is compromised. If a contract is removed from the whitelist, then all states created from that moment on will be constrained by the HashAttachmentConstraint. Note: In future releases, we will provider a tamper-proof way of maintaining the contract whitelist. For fine-grained control of constraints, in case multiple contracts live in the same jar, the tool reads from another file:exclude_whitelist.txt, which contains a list of contracts that should not be whitelisted, and thus default to the very restrictive: HashAttachmentConstraint For example: net.corda.finance.contracts.asset.Cash net.corda.finance.contracts.asset.CommercialPaper Starting the nodes You may now start the nodes in any order. You should see a banner, some log lines and eventually Node started up and registered, indicating that the node is fully started. In terms of process management there is no prescribed method. You may start the jars by hand or perhaps use systemd and friends. Logging Only a handful of important lines are printed to the console. For details/diagnosing problems check the logs. Logging is standard log4j2 and may be configured accordingly. Logs are by default redirected to files in NODE_DIRECTORY/logs/. Connecting to the nodes Once a node has started up successfully you may connect to it as a client to initiate protocols/query state etc. Depending on your network setup you may need to tunnel to do this remotely. See the Using the client RPC API on how to establish an RPC link. Sidenote: A client is always associated with a single node with a single identity, which only sees their part of the ledger.","title":"Build with XinFin Hybrid Network"},{"location":"get-started/hybnet/#xinfin-private-quorumfork","text":"Prerequisite Operating System: Ubuntu 16.04 64-bit or higher Tools: Docker, Docker Compose Hardware: CPU : 24 RAM : 08GB HDD : 500GB Network Ports Following network ports need to be open for the nodes to communicate 21001-2100* TCP/UDP GETH 22001-2200* TCP RPC 23001-2300* TCP RAFT 9001-900* TCP Constellation *-auto-increment depending on number of nodes Clone repository git clone https://github.com/XinFinorg/XDC01-docker-Nnodes.git Step: 1 Install docker & docker-compose sudo ./install_docker.sh Step: 2 Pull image from Docker Hub sudo docker pull xinfinorg/quorum:v2.1.0 Step: 3 Launch the setup script cd static-nodes sudo ./setup.sh Enter number of nodes, private IP of host machine & unique docker subnet.

Each block contains a cryptographic hash of the previous block, a timestamp, and transaction data. By design, a blockchain is resistant to modification of the data. One of the best things about the blockchain is since it is a decentralized system that exists between all permitted parties, there is no need to pay intermediaries (Middlemen) and it saves you time and conflicts. Blockchains have their problems, but they are rated, undeniably, faster, cheaper, and more secure than traditional systems, which is why banks and governments are turning to them. Imagine if there were some self-executing contracts, in which contracts would be converted to computer code, stored and replicated on the system and supervised by the network of computers that run the blockchain. All of this is what makes up smart contracts. What are Smart Contracts?: \u00b6 A smart contract is a computer code running on top of a blockchain containing a set of rules under which the parties to that smart contract agree to interact with each other. If and when the predefined rules are met, the agreement is automatically enforced. The smart contract code facilitates, verifies, and enforces the negotiation or performance of an agreement or transaction. It is the simplest form of decentralized automation. In simpler words, it is rather a form of exchange of any type like money, property etc in a conflict-free way without the services of a middleman so it is trustless execution which is an important feature that smart contracts promises. Bitcoin was the first to support basic smart contracts in the sense that the network can transfer value from one person to another. The network of nodes will only validate transactions if certain conditions are met. Here is an example of a simple smart contract where we use simple set and get function then we increment and decrement some data. Features of Smart Contract \u00b6 Various features provided by smart contracts are: 1.Trust \u2014 Your documents are encrypted on a shared ledger. There\u2019s no way that someone can say they lost it. Smart contracts allow parties to commit and bind by the conditions and rules written inside it. 2.Transparency: Everything is written inside a smart contract with intricate details so anyone can read the details before agreeing and thus eliminates the chance of future disputes. There is no miscommunication as all the information is open with everybody. 3. Autonomous: You\u2019re the one making the agreement; there\u2019s no need to rely on a broker, lawyer or other intermediaries to confirm. This also knocks out the danger of manipulation by a third party, since execution is managed automatically by the network. 4.Accuracy: Automated contracts are not only faster and cheaper but also avoid the errors that come from a person making the contract who can miss some conditions but in smart contracts, it will result in an error, therefore, all the conditions are put in a detailed form. 5.Speed: If anyone would read documents or contracts manually it would take a chunk of time, whereas smart contracts are a bunch of code used to automate task and hence save hours of time. 6.Savings: Smart contracts can help to save a lot of money as it removes the presence of an intermediary. For instance, you would pay a lawyer for your case but in smart contracts, it\u2019s all in your hand as the code is the law. 7.Safety: Cryptographically encryption keeps your data safe. Since they match the highest safety standards, the level of protection involved in them allows to be secure to use for critical processes Problem Solution \u00b6 1.We can solve some of the problems with smart contracts like upgrade problems by using modular smart contracts. So, we can have modular.sol files while building on Ethereum that can be easily upgraded without losing information. 2.Using Delegatecall-based proxies for contract upgrading. In delegatecall logic data are kept in separate contracts, but the data contract (the proxy) calls the logic contract through delegatecall. It is difficult to apply the delegatecall-based proxy pattern correctly. The proxy pattern requires that memory layouts stay consistent between contract and compiler upgrades. A developer unfamiliar with EVM internals can easily introduce critical bugs during an upgrade. 3.The legal issues of smart contracts can only be solved over time as they are in their initial development stage; it will require time. 4.The major problem of writing smart contracts can be solved by not implementing Turing-complete smart contracts. 5.And, the oracle problem can be solved maybe by a consensus protocol in the community itself which will help to see how things are in the physical world. Application of Smart Contracts \u00b6 1.Digital Identity: Smart contracts allow users to own and control their digital identity i.ie data, reputation and assets. It provides enterprises with the opportunity to seamlessly know their customers while individuals may not disclose sensitive data which reduces the frictionless know-your-customer requirements. 2.Financial Data Recording: Financial organizations can utilize smart contracts for accurate, transparent financial data recording. Smart contracts allow for uniform financial data across organizations, improving financial reporting and reducing auditing costs.By improving data integrity, smart contracts support increased market stability. They also reduce accounting costs by allowing cost sharing among organizations. 3.Healthcare: Personal health records could be encoded and stored on the blockchain with a private key which would grant access only to specific individuals. The same strategy could be used to ensure that research is conducted via HIPAA laws (in a secure and confidential way). Receipts of surgeries could be stored on a blockchain and automatically sent to insurance providers as proof-of-delivery. The ledger, too, could be used for general healthcare management, such as supervising drugs, regulation compliance, testing results, and managing healthcare supplies. 4.Real Estate: You can get more money through smart contracts. Ordinarily, if you wanted to rent your apartment to someone, you\u2019d need to pay a middleman such as Craigslist or a newspaper to advertise and then again you\u2019d need to pay someone to confirm that the person paid rent and followed through. The ledger cuts your costs. All you do is pay via bitcoin and encode your contract on the ledger. Conclusion \u00b6 Smart contracts do offer a lot and have shown signs of how promising they can be, but they are still in their initial stages so with time maybe we will see their actual potential which could provide for all sorts of social changes which is really exciting. A big problem lies with the organizations as well, as they are adopting blockchains due to the buzzword but not considering how to use it to its fullest. If organizations manage that beforehand then maybe writing smart contracts can get easier. But the actual problem still lies in writing smart contracts and gaining the trust of people again after the DAO hack. In the coming future, we may witness a hybrid of paper and digital content where contracts are verified via blockchain and substantiated by physical copy.","title":"Smart Contract"},{"location":"get-started/smartcont/#what-are-smart-contracts","text":"A smart contract is a computer code running on top of a blockchain containing a set of rules under which the parties to that smart contract agree to interact with each other.

This powerful technology has so far been implicated in the numerous cryptocurrencies that exist online. Financial institutions are only beginning to understand the potential applications of blockchain in conventionally regulated industries. Understanding the Blockchain : At a fundamental level the blockchain is a data structure that cryptographically links blocks of transactions or any potential transfers of value. As a paradigm, the blockchain allows for true privacy to exist between those involved in a transaction. This characteristic of the blockchain that makes its most significant implementation in the financial industry. Its structure allows for automation, immutability, and decentralization. These characteristics were carefully chosen by Nakamoto in order to create a digital mechanism of trust. For the financial world this would result in a more limited reliance on third party trust mechanisms enabling a direct contractual interface between two parties involved in any transfer of value. This technology has the power make such exchanges safer, faster, and costeffective. Ownership of value stored in the blockchain is established through asymmetrical cryptography. Digital keys, wallet addresses, and digital signatures are all created cryptographically to ensure total privacy in transmission of transactional data. Every transaction on the blockchain needs to be 'signed' using digital keys. Whoever owns these keys, owns access to the value stored in the wallet. All keys generated by the wallet software come in pairs; a private key, which is kept secret and a public key. The public key is akin to a bank account number and the private key is like the secret pin used to control the account. The idea behind digital signatures is that private and public key pair shares a mathematical relationship such that a message (transaction) signed by a private key can be verified by a public key without revealing the private key. Public Blockchain : The Bitcoin's blockchain network is structured as a peer-to-peer network architecture. In this network implementation, all nodes are equal or symmetric. There is no server, no centralized service, and no hierarchy in the Bitcoin's network. Blockchain implementations for the financial industry however, cannot allow for such an open and symmetric network structure. Bitcoin enthusiasts advocate, therefore, that the blockchain and Bitcoin are fundamentally linked. This is a short sighted view taking into consideration that the Bitcoin technology stack exists to solve the problem of an unregulated digital currency. The same stack can be evolved to solve similar transfers of value over an asymmetric network. The XDC Protocol: Technical Whitepaper by Xinfin Organization. September 2017. All rights reserved.

Private Blockchain : Private blockchains came into prominence with the Hyperledger Project that saw participation from IBM and Intel in 2016.
