**XDC/XDCE UTILITY**

The XDC token is the underlying utility token that powers XinFin's Hybrid Blockchain. The XDC token acts as a settlement mechanism for DApps built on the XinFin Hybrid Blockchain. XinFin has also launched an Ethereum token called XDCE that can be traded with XDC utility token at a 1:1 ratio. This gives the token holder flexibility to hold tokens in either form for utility. The ERC-20 token can be swapped for the XDC token at a ratio of 1:1. This swap can be facilitated on the AlphaEx exchange. AlphaEx is compatible with all decentralised exchanges and has a presence in liquidity markets and supports XDC liquidity.
