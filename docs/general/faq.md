**Frequently Asked Questions**

## General

### XinFin Network

!!! quote "What is XinFin Network?"
    XinFin Network is an innovative solution to the scalability problem of the Ethereum blockchain, and other current blockchain platforms.
	XinFin Network relies on a system of 18 Masternodes with Proof of Stake Voting (POSV) consensus that can support low transaction fees and 2-second transaction confirmation times.
	Security, stability and chain finality are guaranteed via novel techniques such as double validation, staking via smart-contracts and true randomization processes.

	XinFin Network supports all EVM-compatible smart-contracts, protocols, and atomic cross-chain token transfers.
	New scaling techniques such as sharding, EVM parallelisation, private-chain generation, hardware integration will be continuously researched and incorporated into XinFin Network's Masternode architecture.
	It will be an ideal scalable smart-contract public blockchain for decentralized apps, token issuances and token integrations for small and big businesses.
	
!!! quote "What problem is XinFin Network aiming to solve?"
	The problems that XinFin Network aims to solve can be summarized as follows:

	- The network congestion on Ethereum (low transaction time)
	- High transaction fees on Ethereum
	- Most other blockchains are highly centralized and/or do not have interoperability with Ethereum system

	Blockchain has become one of the most disruptive technologies that enables many decentralized applications, including but not limited to cryptocurrencies, smart-contracts, voting and supply-chain management.
	Blockchain proponents have been trying to inject it into this Industry 4.0 revolution era.
	In order to reach this goal, the current blockchain infrastructure must at least be able to compete with many mainstream technologies, such as Visa and MasterCard processors in financial services.
	Nevertheless, the reality is disappointing: Bitcoin and Ethereum can only process around 7 and 15 transactions per second, respectively.
	Remember that, these numbers in Visa and MasterCard are around 5'000-6'000 transactions per second.

	XinFin Network is continuously working and researching several scaling solutions.
	Regarding on-chain scaling, Sharding and Proof-of-Stake-based consensus are of potential that can significantly improve transaction processing performance while trying to maintain security requirements of the system. 

	XinFin Network supports low fee and 2-second transaction confirmation times.
	XinFin Network can currently process 2'000-5'000 transactions per second (TPS) and once sharding is enabled, XinFin Network is expected to reach 20'000-30'000 TPS.

!!! quote "How does XinFin Network work? What is the architecture and consensus used?"
    XinFin Network relies on a system of Masternodes with Proof of Stake Voting (POSV) consensus that can support low fees (approx. 1/10 of that of Ethereum's) and 2-second transaction confirmation times.
	Security, stability and chain finality are guaranteed via novel techniques such as Double Validation, staking via smart-contracts and true randomization processes.

!!! quote "Can you tell more about Proof of Stake Voting (PoSV)? What is it?"
    At the heart of XinFin Network, the Proof-of-Stake Voting (PoSV) consensus enables XinFin Network as an EVM-compatible and scalable public blockchain, on which every Ethereum smart contract can be effectively run with almost instant transaction confirmation.

	PoSV features its Masternode architecture in which token holders deposit 50k XinFin to become a masternode candidate and receive votes from other token holders.
	The most voted masternode candidates are selected as masternodes for block creation within a period, called epoch.
	Each masternode takes its block creation in a round-robin manner every 2-second and follows the double validation technique for security reinforcement.
	A block is finalised if it is signed off by 3/4 masternodes.
	At the end of each epoch, the masternodes that have signed finalised blocks are rewarded.
	Stakers who voted for those masternodes will also be rewarded.

!!! quote "What is Double Validation?"
    Double Validation provides an additional trustless validation layer for security enhancement through a provable uniform distribution decentralized randomization.
	Specifically, when a block is created by a masternode, it must be verified by another masternode that is randomly selected among the set of masternodes before being added to the blockchain.
	Double validation strengthens XinFinchain’s security, reduces fork and nothing-at-stake attacks, and makes XinFin Network unique among other Proof-of-Stake-based blockchains.
	
!!! quote "What is an 'epoch'?"
    An epoch is a 900-block period of 2-second block time starting from block #1 (900 blocks x 2s/block = around 1800s or ~30 minutes).

!!! quote "Which scaling solutions will XinFin Network implement? Will you have sharding?"
    XinFin Network solutions are based on on-chain scaling built into an architecture of 150 voted masternodes with our Proof-of-stake Voting (POSV) consensus protocol.
	We achieve 2-second block-time and almost instant transaction confirmation.

	To scale further our infrastructure, we have presented our [Sharding proposal](https://bit.ly/2xHK0u3) for uniquely integrating Sharding into our current architecture and consensus.

	Besides sharding, we are actively researching scalability solutions like EVM parallelization and Plasma.
	New scaling techniques such as sharding, EVM parallelisation, private-chain generation, hardware integration will be evaluated before being integrated into XinFin Network's masternode architecture.

!!! quote "What is the current TPS? What is your targeted transaction speed and when do you think you can achieve that speed?"
    XinFin Network supports low transaction fees (approx. 1/10 of that of Ethereum's) and 2-second transaction confirmation times.
	The mainnet with POSV Masternodes delivers 2'000 transactions per second (TPS).
	Once sharding is implemented, we expect 20'000-30'000 TPS.

	XinFin Network team is continuously researching other scaling techniques to keep improving.

!!! quote "What makes XinFin Network different?"
    The unique point of XinFin Network comes from technology, the products and the ecosystem.

	**Novel technology:** includes
	
	- Proof of Stake Voting consensus
	- Build in governance D-app
	- Double Validation and Randomization
	- Sharding based on a stable masternode artichitecture

	This enables XinFin Network to achieve:
	
	- Cheap transactions: approx. 1/10 of that of Ethereum
	- 2000 TPS to handle a robust d-app and token ecosystem; TPS will be dramatically higher once our sharding solution is enabled (20k-30k TPS)
	- 2 second block time for fast transactions
	- EVM-compatibility allows for interoperability with Ethereum ecosystem.

	**Our unique products**

	- XinFinScan: Shows all blocks, transactions, finality, smart contracts, D-Apps and token information
	- XinFinMaster: Allows users to apply for a Masternode Candidate position; to vote for Masternodes and shows Masternode performance statistics
	- xdcwallet: Securely store, send, receive XinFin and other tokens issued on XinFin Network; Allows users to vote and track rewards

	**Our own ecosystem**

	- XinFin Network also is working vigorously on building its ecosystem and has sealed many partnerships from all fields such as agriculture, robotics, gaming, IT solution providers, advertising, pharmaceutical tracking, education and research, payment, communication, name service, food traceability, tourism etc
	
!!! quote "How does XinFin Network compare with other available blockchain projects?"
	Some of our competitors are EOS.IO, Casper FFG, Cardano, Tendermint, Lisk.
	We are doing a series of Medium posts on this matter.

	Some posts have been published, such as ["Blockchain comparison overview: EOS.IO, Casper FFG, Cardano, Tendermint and XinFinchain"](https://medium.com/XinFin Network/blockchain-comparison-overview-eos-io-casper-ffg-cardano-tendermint-and-XinFin Network-2b0df68806b6),
	a detailed comparison with EOS [XinFinchain vs. EOS.IO: The battle of PoSV vs. DPoS or just some coincidence of design philosophy?](https://medium.com/XinFin Network/XinFin Network-vs-eos-io-the-battle-of-posv-vs-dpos-or-just-some-coincidence-of-design-philosophy-b5f606a1e5df),
	and a [Comparison of PoS-voting based reward engines among XinFin Network, EOS and Lisk](https://medium.com/XinFin Network/XinFin Network-eos-lisk-comparison-of-pos-voting-based-reward-engine-9b3b26560392).

    The world is a pretty big place, and startups often kill themselves because they cannot make a desirable product, not because of the competition.
	At the moment, besides the core XinFin Network platform, we want to focus on a few quality Dapp use cases that can make a difference.
	Quality before quantity.

	Our core blockchain solution like the sharding proposal is of very high quality, and potentially better than multiple high profile attempts at scaling currently.
	The solution is also very unique to XinFin Network's Marsternode design, which will remain our competitive product advantage for a long time.

	There are also several other product solutions in design stage which also highly integrate with XinFinchain's overall design.
	These product innovations is one of the core competencies we have that make XinFinchain very unique compared to other big projects.
	We are doing our best to solve the scalability problem, maximize the TPS and stay strong in our target market. 

!!! quote "Which blockchain(s) are XinFin Network's main competitors?"
    On the one hand, all base layer blockchains such as Ethereum, EOS, NEM, NEO, XinFin Network etc are competitors because app developers/token issuers will generally choose only one blockchain to work on.
	On the other hand, it is too early to focus on competition as it is more important to expand the whole blockchain ecosystem rather than to compete.

	XinFin Network has a unique position in which it adds value to the Ethereum ecosystem by addressing scalability and governance issues while keeping the same smart-contracts and general architecture.

!!! quote "XinFin Network is EVM-compatible. What does that mean?"
    EVM means Ethereum Virtual Machine.
	XinFin Network supports all EVM-compatible smart-contracts, protocols, and atomic cross-chain token transfers.
	This means that any smart-contract written in Ethereum protocol can be easily ported to XinFin Network.
	Any d-App written in Ethereum can be seamlessly ported to XinFin Network.
	
!!! quote "Is XinFin Network a side-chain of Ethereum?"
    XinFin Network has its own blockchain since XinFin Network Mainnet was launched in December 14th, 2018.
	
!!! quote "Is XinFin Network compatible with Ethereum?"
    Yes, any smart-contract written in Ethereum protocol can be easily ported to XinFin Network.
	This is one strength appealing to some dApp developers and some of our partners.
	
!!! quote "Can developers make hybrid dApps using both Ethereum and XinFin Network in one single dApp?"
    Yes, they can make an app, and deploy it to both Ethereum, and XinFin Network.
	It can be done relatively easy since XinFin Network supports EVM, and share a common architecture with Ethereum.

!!! quote "How do you solve 'security problems' when using XinFin Network?"
    In terms of security of consensus protocol, XinFin Network proposes Double Validation and Randomization to protect the system.
	The details of these techniques can be referred in our [Technical paper](https://xinfin.org/docs/technical-whitepaper--1.0.pdf).

	XinFin Network solves some consensus-related security aspects:
	
	1. Nothing-at-stake problem: This problem is commonly discussed in PoS-based blockchain consensus and just like 51% attacks in PoW. XinFin Network solves it by using Double Validation and Randomization.
		The details are shown in our technical paper.
	2. Long-range attacks: Attackers can try to recreate all blocks from a very far position to the current block.
		Attackers can do that because PoS-based consensus does not require extra-ordinary hashing power to re-write the whole blockchain.
		XinFin Network addresses by providing finality.
		Once a block is signed by at least 3/4 masternodes, it is consider irreversible, meaning that any attempt to re-write the blockchain history will be rejected.
	3. Censorship-resistance: Please [refer to this medium article](https://medium.com/XinFin Network/XinFin Network-vs-eos-io-the-battle-of-posv-vs-dpos-or-just-some-coincidence-of-design-philosophy-b5f606a1e5df) for more detailed analysis
	4. DDoS and spamming attacks: XinFin Network's transaction fee is not zero (even it is very low), attackers still require a significant amount of XinFin in order to flood the network for only a short time.

!!! quote "How does XinFin Network defend against spamming attacks?"
    XinFin Network has different measures to defend against spamming attacks.
	
	For instance, increasing transaction fees for smart contract creation is one of them.
	The min is 10 XinFin. Otherwise an error of smart contract creation cost is under allowance may show up.

### XinFin - Economics
	
!!! quote "What is XinFin? Can you describe the functions and purposes of XinFin?"
    XinFin is the native cryptocurrency of XinFin Network and will be the reserve cryptocurrency for all third-party apps running on XinFin Network.
	Being the protocol token for the XinFin Network infrastructure, XinFin will be needed by all parties utilising XinFin Network to build apps or issue and integrate cryptographic tokens into their apps.

	The supply of XinFin is fixed, long-term and non-inflationary.

	In addition to the above, XinFin is an integral part of the XinFin Network network for a number of reasons.
	
	- XinFin will be used to fund the development of XinFin Network and its ecosystem (XinFinScan, XinFinMater, xdcwallet, etc.).
	- XinFin will be used as a reward to incentivise the building of the XinFin Network engine/ecosystem.
	- XinFin will be used as a long-term, decentralized governance instrument of the XinFin Network network.

	You can check our [technical whitepaper](https://docs.xinfin.org/wp-and-research/technical-whitepaper/) for more details.

!!! quote "Can I mine XDC?"
    XDC is not `mineable` but `mintable` by masternodes.
	Masternodes are responsible for creating, verifying and finalizing the blocks created within a period, called epoch.
	Masternodes and Stakers will receive block rewards.
	
!!! quote "What is XinFin circulating supply and total supply?"
    The initial circulating supply at genesis block is 55'000'000 but the current circulating supply is increasing every epoch.
	
	After 8 years, XinFin total supply is fixed at 100'000'000 XDC.
	
!!! quote "How is XinFin distributed?"
    The token allocation is splitted as follows:
	
	- 55 millions XinFin was already allocated after the token sale period;
	- 12 millions XinFin are reserved for the team vested over the next 4 years;
	- 16 millions XinFin are reserved for strategic partners and an ecosystem building fund;
	- 17 millions XinFin are reserved as block rewards for the next 8 years

!!! quote "How are block rewards distributed?"
    17 millions XinFin are reserved as block rewards for the next 8 years.
	
	- 1st and 2nd year: 4 million XinFin annually
	- 3rd, 4th and 5th year: 2 million XinFin annually
	- 6th, 7th and 8th year: 1 million XinFin annually

!!! quote "Will XinFin Network have inflation?"
    The total supply is fixed at 100 million XinFin in the first 8 years (non-inflationary).
	17 million XinFin which are reserved as block rewards will have been all distributed after 8 years.
	At that time, we are expecting that block rewards will come from the exchange fees.
	But the Masternode Council can decide to increase the total supply by 0.5-1 million XinFin per year (which will be used as block rewards) (~small inflation, 0.5%-1% annually).

!!! quote "How often are block rewards paid out?"
    Block rewards will be earnt every epoch, which lasts for 900 of two-second-block time (~30 minutes).
	Stakers will be also rewarded.

!!! quote "If XinFin Network has zero fees, how can Masternodes get rewards?"
    The block rewards will be emitted from a reserved fund with 17 million XinFin for the first 8 years.
	The block rewards are as follows:
	
	- 1st and 2nd year: 4 million XinFin annually
	- 3rd, 4th and 5th year: 2 million XinFin annually
	- 6th, 7th and 8th year: 1 million XinFin annually

	We plan to have a built-in DEX, the revenues from the DEX will go to the Masternodes as well.

	After 8 years, the block rewards will come from the exchange fees.
	Also, the Masternode Council can decide to increase the total supply by 0.5-1 million XinFin per year (which will be used as block rewards).

!!! quote "What is the price in presale and ICO?"
    Presale Price: `$0.2`
	
	ICO Price: `$0.25` (`0.0003125 ETH`)

!!! quote "When will XinFin be listed on new exchanges?"
    We do not discuss about exchange related questions due to the regulation.
	We will announce every exchange news on our official channels on due time.

!!! quote "Is XinFin an ERC-20 token?"
    Since Mainnet, XinFin has become the native coin of the XinFin Network blockchain.


!!! quote "Where to store XDCE? How can I send XDCE to my wallet?"
    You can store XinFin in xdcwallet, TrustWallet, MetaMask, MyEtherWallet, Ledger and Trezor.

	We recommend to store XDCE in xdcwallet.

    You can trade XinFin on various exchanges.
	Take a look in the "Exchanges" section [on this page](https://xinfin.org/about-us/) of our main website.
	
### Masternodes	

!!! quote "Does XinFin Network have Masternodes? How do they work?"
    Yes, XinFin Network has a maximum of 150 Masternodes with Proof of Stake Voting (POSV) consensus for low transaction fee, and instant transaction confirmation.
	Masternodes create, verify and validate new blocks in XinFinChain’s platform.

	- **Masternode Candidates:** Any account can deposit 50,000 XinFin using [XinFinMaster](https://master.xinfin.org/) to become a masternode candidate.
	A candidate can resign, but the tokens will be locked for the next 30 days (1,296,000 blocks) after the resignation.
	- **Becoming a Masternode:** A candidate becomes a masternode when he/she belongs to the top 150 most voted candidates in each epoch.
	A Masternode can resign, but the tokens will be locked for the next 30 days after the resignation.
	- **Rewards:** The rewards a masternode receives in each epoch is proportional to the number of signatures it signs.
	Masternodes will also receive fees from the XinFin Network DEX, which is planned for development in Q1 2019.

	XinFin Network masternodes started signing blocks and receiving block rewards with the Mainnet release in December 14th, 2018.

!!! quote "What is a masternode in the XinFin Network ecosystem?"
    A XinFin Network masternode is a server which uses its computing power to contribute to the network.
	Its job is to create and sign blocks.
	For this contribution to the network, masternodes receive rewards in the form of XinFin.

	Masternodes are elected using the PoSV consensus via our governance dApp [XinFinMaster](https://master.xinfin.org/)

!!! quote "What are the incentives to run a masternode?"
    Masternodes contribute to the network and for this work they will receive a significant amount of block rewards, which will likely exceed the cost for running the infrastructure.
	However, masternode owners need to invest in XinFin Network by depositing at least 50'000 XinFin, and stake them in the long term.

	After the initial deposit, if the account does not become a masternode (has less votes than the top 150 most voted candidates), he will not receive rewards.
	Therefore, candidates are incentivised to do as much as they can to signal their capability to support XinFin Network to get into top 150 most voted candidates.

!!! quote "How did you decide on 150 masternodes? Why did you decide to increase this from the initial 99?"
    The reason came from both decentralization consideration, and also scalability consideration.
	In terms of decentralization, 150 is better than 99.
	The more important consideration is the scalability.
	We also increased the number of masternodes to better suit the sharding solution later.

	Also 150 is [Dunbar’s Number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunbar%27s_number).

!!! quote "Where will the Masternode rewards come from? Will they be from the DEX?"
    The block rewards will come from a 17 million XinFin reserve for the next 8 years - this was decided since the genesis block.
	Our [Economics paper](https://docs.xinfin.org/wp-and-research/economics-paper/) lays out the number in detail.

	And then later on, because we plan to have a built-in DEX, the revenues from the DEX will go to the Masternodes as well.

!!! quote "When are Masternode rewards paid out?"
    Masternode operators and stakers will receive rewards every epoch.
	An epoch is a 900-block period of 2-second block time (~30 minutes). 

!!! quote "How can I check my rewards?"
    You can check your masternode/staking rewards using xdcwallet.
	Alternatively you can use XinFinMaster or XinFinScan.

!!! quote "How much rewards will Masternodes receive?"
    Each epoch consists of 900 blocks, which will reward a total of 250 XinFin in the first two years.
	This amount of 250 XinFin will be divided to all of the Masternodes proportionally to the number of signatures they sign during the epoch.

	Example: With only 25 Masternodes and equal performances, every masternode would be rewarded with 10 XinFin. With 125 Masternodes, each one would receive 2 XinFin per epoch.

	Please, refer to our [Economics paper](https://docs.xinfin.org/wp-and-research/economics-paper/) for more details about the masternodes reward.
	
!!! quote "How much reward from Masternodes will go to the Masternode infrastructure (node owner) and how much is for voters?"
    There is a reward sharing ratio among token holders and masternode who has been elected supported by the token holders.
	The reward achieved by each Masternode will be divided into three portions:

	- **Infrastructure Reward:** The first portion of 40% called Infrastructure Reward goes to the Masternode operator.
	- **Staking Reward:** The second portion of 50% called Staking Reward goes to the pool of all voters for that Masternode which is shared proportionally based on the token stake.
	The Masternode also gets proportional rewards for his 50K XinFin initial deposit.
	- **Foundation Reward:** The last portion of 10% called Foundation Reward goes to a special account controlled by the Masternode Foundation, which is run by the XinFin Network company initially. 

!!! quote "What is the expected ROI for Masternodes and Stakers?"
    The rewards for every masternode will be dynamic and depending on multiple factors like: number of masternodes in the network, the efficiency signing blocks, the total number of votes on each masternode.
	The most efficient masternodes signing blocks will receive higher rewards.

	Please, refer to our [Economics paper](https://docs.xinfin.org/wp-and-research/economics-paper/) for more details about the masternodes reward.
	We discuss 3 possible scenarios with 50, 100 and 150 Masternodes; and different number of total votes.

	One example is outlined below.

	Scenario: 150 Masternodes, 12.5 million tokens voting (a total of 20 million token locked).

	Reward achieved per epoch (900 blocks):
	
	- `By a Masternode = 0.6667 XinFin`
	- `By a Voter with 1K XinFin staked = 0.00625 XinFin`
	
	Approximate reward achieved per week:
	
	- `By a Masternode = 224 XinFin`
	- `By a Voter with 1K XinFin staked = 2.1 XinFin`
	
	Approximate reward achieved per year:
	
	- `By a Masternode = 11,680 XinFin`
	- `By a Voter with 1K XinFin staked = 109.5 XinFin (10.95% annually)`
	- `By a Voter with 50K XinFin staked = 5,475 XinFin`	
	- `Total reward for a Masternode with a 50K XinFin deposit: 11,680 + 5,475 = 17,155 XinFin (34.31% annually)`

### Masternode Candidate

!!! quote "What is a masternode candidate? What is the difference between masternode candidate and masternode?"
    A Masternode Candidate is any node who deposited 50K XinFin and is listed on [XinFinMaster](https://master.xinfin.org/).
	
	One Candidate only becomes a Masternode when he is in the top-150 most-voted masternode candidates in an epoch.
	Only these elected masternodes will be able to sign blocks and receive block rewards.

!!! quote "How can I become a Masternode?"
    The first step to become a masternode, is becoming a masternode candidate.
	To become a Masternode Candidate you need:
	
	- to run XinFin Network software in a machine with certain minimal hardware requirements
	- to deposit 50’000 XinFin in a smart-contract via XinFinMaster

	The list of Masternode Candidates will be available on the governance DApp, [XinFinMaster](https://master.xinfin.org/).
	The next step is to be elected as one of the top 150 most voted candidates. 
	
!!! quote "Do I need to use my own computer to run a node?"
    We recommend using an IaaS ("cloud") provider of your choice (like Amazon AWS, Digital Ocean, Google Cloud GCE, Vultr, etc).
	The machine must be directly facing internet (public IP, no NAT) and with 100% uptime.

	If you have other production grade environment than cloud provider at your disposal, please tell us more about on our [Gitter](https://gitter.im/XinFin Network).

!!! quote "Which are the hardware requirements to run a node?"
    Processing transactions is mostly CPU bound.
	Therefore we recommend running CPU optimized servers.
	
	- Directly facing internet (public IP, no NAT)
	- 16 cores CPU
	- 32GB of RAM
	- SSD storage

	We recommend using popular cloud providers as their reliability and uptime are close to 100%.
	Those servers would be a good starting point:
	
	- **DigitalOcean:** CPU optimized droplet 32GB/16CPU
	- **Amazon EC2:** C5 instance
	- **Google Cloud Engine:** n1-highcpu-16

	Setting up a masternode candidate on a weaker machine might result in poor performances, significantly impacting owner's rewards and the chain performance.

	**Note:** If you are running a node in Testnet, 2CPU/8GB of RAM is sufficient.
	
!!! quote "How do Masternode Candidates become Masternodes?"
    Once you are a Masternode Candidate, you need the support of XinFin Network community in the form of votes.
	The top 150 most voted candidates every period called epoch (900 blocks of 2-second block-time) will be promoted to Masternode.
	This list will change dynamically every epoch.
	Only the 150 masternodes elected will be able to sign blocks and will receive rewards in the form of XinFin. 

!!! quote "Is there any guide on 'How to run a masternode from A to Z'?"
    See this [Medium post](https://medium.com/XinFin Network/how-to-run-a-XinFin Network-masternode-from-a-to-z-3793752dc3d1).
 
!!! quote "Where can I find the latest masternode guide or the instructions for setting up a masternode?"
    Find more details about tmn here: [https://docs.xinfin.org/masternode/tmn/](https://docs.xinfin.org/masternode/tmn/) 

!!! quote "What is the command to start a fullnode with 'tmn'?"
    `tmn start --name node_name --net mainnet --pkey your_private_key`

!!! quote "tmn is installed but just not in your path."
    See: [https://docs.xinfin.org/masternode/tmn/#tmn-command-not-found](https://docs.xinfin.org/masternode/tmn/#tmn-command-not-found)

!!! quote "I tried stopping the node using 'tmn stop', but after that I ran 'tmn status' it still says running."
    You can run `tmn --debug stop` and send the log to us.
	We will help you to investigate the issue.

!!! quote "Do I need two wallets to run a Masternode?"
    It is recommended for security reasons.
	You can create your wallet from wherever you want, the only rule being that you need two of them.
	One for your masternode, and one to make the 50K deposit (this account will receive the rewards).

!!! quote "What is the 'coinbase address'?"
    'Coinbase address' is the public address used to run your node and register it to the system.

	We recommend using two addresses when running your nodes.
	The public address or 'coinbase address' will only receive transaction fees.
	The private address is from where you make the initial 50K XinFin deposit and where the block rewards will be collected.

!!! quote "How can I create a public 'coinbase address' wallet? Is it only with xdcwallet for iOS and Android? Are there other options?"
    You need to create a wallet for the masternode public address.
	This wallet does not need to contain any XinFin, think of it as a shell address.
	You will then stake XinFin into the masternode address via your main XinFin wallet.

	You can use the iOS and Android apps.
	Also you can create wallets with Metamask, MyEtherWallet.

	You can also use [https://wallet.testnet.xinfin.org](https://wallet.testnet.xinfin.org) to create an empty wallet, then use it as coinbase address.

!!! quote "I noticed that we need another wallet for masternode with a different mnemonic. Assume we use a hardware wallet, we would need another hardware wallet with different mnemonic?"
    It is recommended to use a separate empty account for your masternode as it only receive transactions fees - what we call public or 'coinbase address' on the documentation.

	The block rewards are sent to the account connected to XinFinMaster who make the initial deposit - the 'private' address.

!!! quote "Can I use the same address pair (tmn public address + initial deposit address) for all my nodes? Or I have to transfer tokens to another wallet and start the second node?"
    No.
	Must use different public 'coinbase' addresses.
	But you can use the same initial deposit ('private') address, then all rewards will be transferred to only one address.

!!! quote "I have finished all steps of setting up node. Why I don't see my node on XinFinMaster?"
    You must apply to become a masternode candidate.
	
!!! quote "Do I need to deposit the 50K XinFin before or after running 'tmn' in VPS?"
    After. Your node must be fully synched before applying.

!!! quote "How do I check the blockchain sync status from the node?"
    You can watch the logs, but it is easier from the XinFinStats website or its eth.blockNumber API call.

!!! quote "If the masternode owner deposits 60K XinFin instead of 50K on its own node, can it later on unstake the excess 10K?"
    Yes, it can.

!!! quote "How can I change my node's name?"
    You can do it on XinFinMaster.
	Go to your masternode page on XinFinMaster, if you are logged in XinFinMaster with the owner account, you can click next to the masternode name to edit infos.

!!! quote "My node status is 'Proposed', will it change status with next checkpoint?"
    Yes, if you are in top-150 most voted.

!!! quote "Why is a node flagged as 'Slashed'?"
    A masternode will be automatically slashed by the Slashing Mechanism if the node doesn't validate any block within an epoch.

	Some reasons for this might be that the masternode does not have the correct XinFin Network software, lack of memory or masternode crashes due to the lack of e-maintenance and operation by the masternode owner.

	A Slashed node will be 'kicked out' for the next 4 epochs.
	At the 5th epoch after being slashed, the slashed masternode can go back to the candidate list.

!!! quote "How do I update my Masternode to the newest version?"
    Run this command: `pip3 install -U tmn && tmn update && tmn start`
	
!!! quote "How many nodes I am allowed to run?"
    As many as you can.

!!! quote "How can I resign as Masternode?"
    If you no longer want to be a masternode, you can resign on XinFinMaster.
	Your masternode will stop generating rewards and your funds will be locked for 30 days (1 296 000 blocks).
	After the lockup period you will be able to withdraw your 50’000 XinFin deposit.

!!! quote "Can I close the node entirely, then start a new one with a totally separate coinbase address without being penalized?"
    No.
	Your old node will be penalized (50K initial deposit 30-day lockup) and your new node has to apply again.
	
!!! quote "Is it possible to move a masternode later, like backup and start it from another IP address?"
    Yes.

!!! quote "What if I do not have enough XinFin for a masternode? Can I stake my coins?"
    Yes.
	Token holders can stake XinFin and receive rewards.

	To stake XinFin you need to vote for masternode candidates by sending XinFin to each candidates specific voting-address using the official governance d-App: XinFinMaster.`
	The top-150 most voted candidates will become masternodes.
	Token holders can also un-vote candidates, but the tokens will be locked for the next 96 epochs / 8,640 blocks (approx. 48 hours) after the un-voting.

	Masternode token deposits, and all tokens used to vote for masternodes will enter the staking program, and earn block rewards in each epoch, plus any fees.
	Tokens used to vote for candidates who do not become masternodes will not earn staking rewards.

### Voter	
	
!!! quote "What are the voters incentives? Do voters get rewards too?"
    Token voters should vote for the candidates who demonstrate strong support to the XinFin Network ecosystem.
	If strong candidates are voted to become masternodes, the network will be more powerful and the voters will earn more rewards.

	More information on the voting and reward mechanism in the [Economics paper](https://docs.google.com/document/d/197Cu57A6OYPoEQbrUVr067qNVEzP_FEwaDCFff7hnlM).

!!! quote "Can you stake XinFin?"

	To vote, they must deposit XinFin in a smart-contract associated with the voted candidate.

	The top-150 most-voted candidates will be promoted to masternode during the next epoch and will be able to sign blocks and collect rewards.
	All the voters (stakers) who supported the elected masternodes will receive rewards proportional to the amount of XinFin voted.

!!! quote "How do I vote?"
    Any token holder can vote.
	Login to XinFinMaster and then click 'Vote' on a node.

!!! quote "Ledger not working?"
    Upgrade your Ledger to the newest firmware.

!!! quote "Can I use Trezor to vote for masternodes?"
    Yes. XinFinMaster supports Trezor now.
	
!!! quote "What criteria must be considered when voting? Which masternode candidate should I vote for?"
    The most important criteria to maximize voter’s profit, the main points you should consider when voting, are the following:

	- **Top-150 most voted:** Your candidate must be one of the top-150 most-voted. If your candidate gets in the 151th most-voted place, it will not be promoted to masternode and you will earn zero rewards.
	- **Hardware, Performance:** Powerful CPU, RAM, bandwidth, latency, etc so the node can work hard and receive high rewards
	- **Number of signed blocks:** The more signed blocks per epoch, the higher rewards
	- **Time of last signed block:** Verify that the masternode is active
	- **Total Capacity:** Staking rewards are shared between all the masternode votes. Less voted masternodes are more profitable. 5K staked on a 50K-staked masternode will receive ten times more rewards than 5K staked on a 500K total staked masternode.
	- **Social Proof, Reputation:** Masternodes managed by trusted companies that are for the long term, maintaining the masternode, updating hardware and software to last versions, fixing problems, etc.

!!! quote "How many Masternode Candidates can I vote for?"
    You can vote for as many candidates as you wish, splitting your XinFin.

	Example: If you have 1'000 XinFin you can vote 500 XinFin for candidate A, 450 XinFin for candidate B, and 50 XinFin for candidate C.

!!! quote "What is the minimum amount to Stake?"
    The minimum amount to stake is 100 XinFin.
	
!!! quote "Which hardware-wallet can I use to vote?"
    You are able to use hardware wallets (Ledger, Trezor) with MyEtherWallet or Metamask.
	You can also directly connect to the XinFin Network Mainnet with Ledger/Trezor and vote on [XinFinMaster](https://master.xinfin.org/).

!!! quote "Is it possible to re-invest the XinFin earned and use it to continue voting?"
    Yes.

!!! quote "Is there a way to stake the earned rewards automatically?"
    This is not supported currently.

!!! quote "What happens if the Masternode I voted for stops working? Will I get my XinFin back?"
    Yes. You can unvote that masternode and take your tokens back after 48h lock-up period.

!!! quote "How do I UnVote?"
    If you do not want to support a masternode you voted for, you can unvote it by clicking the ‘Unvote’ button on the masternode's page and enter the amount of XinFin you wish to unvote.

	After unvoting, your XinFin are still locked in the smart contract for 96 epochs (approx. 48 hours) before you are able to withdraw.
	When the lockup period is finished you need to click the ‘Withdraw’ button and the coins will appear again on your wallet.

!!! quote "How to withdraw after unvoting?"
    After unvoting, you need to wait until your XinFin is unlocked from the smart contract (96 epochs, approx. 48 hours).
	Then you can go to XinFinMaster and click the 'Withdraw' button in your account page (the three vertical dots on the top-right) and choose which withdrawal you want to receive back your XinFin.

	Note that you might see multiple withdrawals on your account page if you made multiple unvotes previously.

	We also calculate the reward based on sign transactions number.


!!! quote "What is a 'checkpoint'?"
    For each iteration of 900 blocks (called epoch), a checkpoint block is created, which implements only reward works.
	The masternode, who takes turn in the circular and sequential order to create blocks, has to scan all of the created blocks in the epoch and count number of signatures.

	It is worth noting that token holders who unvote before the checkpoint block will not receive any shared reward in the Staking Reward portion.
