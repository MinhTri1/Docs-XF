# Create new wallet

You can create a new wallet, if you click on "CREATE NEW WALLET" after launching the App. 
You will receive a recovery passphrase consisting of 12 words to restore your wallet in case you lose your password.
To protect your wallet you should click on "Settings" > "Create passcode" so all transfers from your wallet will need to be confirmed with a passcode.

# Import wallet

By clicking on "IMPORT YOUR WALLET" after launching the App, you can choose to import your wallet either with your private key or your recovery passphrase. There is also a "view only" mode, where you just have to enter your adress. You can monitor, but not send any transactions in this mode.

# Receive XDC

By clicking on "Adress" you can either receive TOMO by sharing your adress or your QR-code. It's also possible to create a QR-code that requests a certain amount.

# Send XDC

By clicking on "Send" you can either send TOMO by scanning a QR-code or entering a recipient adress manually.

# Vote for masternodes

XDC Wallet has an integrated voting function, that enables 
stakeholders to vote without having to login to the masternode platform.
Token holders are recommended to read this [Voting tutorial](/tomowallet/voting/) for how to vote 
for masterrnodes using XDC Wallet.
