This page will provide users with an overview of XinFin Network's product map and 
[how to read](/get-started/how_to_read/) the documentation site, depending on readers' interest.

The backbone of XinFin Network's products and ecosystem is the XinFin Network blockchain 
with its innovative XDPOS consensus.
To facilitate interactions between users (including masternode owners) 
and the XinFin Network blockchain, 
a set of products have been built, including XinFin Explorer, XinFin Masternode, XinFin Wallet, 
and our Network stats page.
XinFin Network has been also developing a decentralized exchange protocol with 
its relayer-based architecture.
These products will be continuously improved in our long-term plan.
Furthermore, more highly innovative products and technologies will be intensively
developed and researched to make XinFin Network become an ideal platform for blockchain 
games, open finance, and enterprise-oriented applications.
