**What is a StableCoin? Explaining Stablecoin**

XinFin XDC Network's Stable coins aim to bridge the gap between cryptocurrencies’ benefits and the stable nature offered by fiat currencies. It is a crypto token with a value pegged to the price of a national currency to combat its volatility.

Now, the question is, why do we need a stable coin.

Though cryptocurrencies are global currencies, coins like Bitcoin and Ether are volatile. The price of Bitcoin raised from $1000 to $20000 during 2017. Since it is not sustainable, users and investors require more stability in the market.

Imagine that you pay $30 for dinner today and the same amount would be worth $40 tomorrow because the value of that crypto token went up. Small investors cannot handle that kind of volatility. Therefore, stable coins emerged as a new technique to drive the new way of adoption to cryptocurrencies.

You might think why do we need to create fiat-backed crypto tokens instead of just using fiat currency. Decentralized currencies do not require any centralized authority to bring trust in the system, thereby reducing additional costs involved.

Also, cross border payments can be made quickly with cryptocurrencies. Backing crypto tokens with stable fiat currency or assets can add more value and build more trust among investors and users.

**What are the types of StableCoins?**

1. Fiat-backed
Fiat backed stablecoins are crypto tokens associated with the value of a specific fiat currency. These tokens hold their value fixed at 1:1 ratio. 
For example, Tether is a stable coin, which is pegged 1:1 to the US dollar. Fiat currency is deposited as collateral to ensure the existence of a fiat-backed stablecoin. As a result, it requires financial custodian and regular auditing to determine that the token always remains collateralized. e.g: Facebook LIBRA, USD Coin (USDC), Gemini stablecoin (GUSDT) etc

2. Non-collateralized
Non-collateralized stablecoins are based on the concept of a Seigniorage Shares system. Seigniorage is the difference between the value of money and its printing cost. 
These coins depend on the algorithm, which changes the supply volume to control their price. Using smart contracts, these stable coins are sold if the price falls below the pegged currency and more tokens are supplied to the market if its value rises above the pegged currency.

3. Cryptocurrency-backed
Cryptocurrency-backed stable coins work similarly to that of a fiat-backed stablecoin. However, it locks up cryptocurrency as collateral instead of using fiat currency. For example, Ethereum can be kept as collateral to create a cryptocurrency-backed stablecoin. 
These tokens use a security pledge to compensate for the volatility of cryptocurrency to be used as collateral. It states that the stablecoin will not be based on 1:1 ration for the crypto collateral.


4. Commodity-collateralized
Commodity-collateralized stablecoins are backed by other types of interchangeable assets like real estate and precious metals. Gold is one of the most common commodities to be collateralized. Commodity-backed stable coins hold a tangible asset with some real value. These commodities can appreciate value over time, which offers an increased incentive to people to use and keep these coins.
Using commodity-collateralized stable coins, anyone can invest in real estate properties or precious metals across the world. Generally, the investment in such assets is only reserved for the wealthy class of investors. However, stablecoins open up investment opportunities for average individuals globally.

The adoption of stablecoins will support the capital market formation and present new opportunities for decentralized finance on the blockchain like derivatives markets and lending. USDT or tether stablecoin widely used in cryptocurrency indutry. 


**Real-World Applications of Stable Coins**

In case, the fiat currency crashes in value; local citizens can exchange the crashed money for EUR-backed, USD-backed, or asset-backed stablecoins before they lose their savings. In this way, people get protected from further drops in the value of the local currency.

For example, currently, Venezuela is facing hyperinflation. The prices of goods in that country have been doubling almost every week on average.

Annual inflation rate at the end of 2018 in Venezuela was 80,000%. Most of the citizens cannot even afford food as their savings became worthless and the value continued to drop with each passing day.

Stablecoins can offer an ideal solution to all such people by allowing them to exchange their dropped currency holdings with a stable currency.
